      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a topological space;
          let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
          Suppose that for each <m>x \in A</m> there is an open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m> such that <m>U \ss A</m>.
          Show that <m>A</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For each <m>x \in A</m> we can choose an open set <m>U_x</m> containing <m>x</m> such that <m>U_x \ss A</m>.
            We then claim that <m>\bigcup_{x \in A} U_x = A</m>.
            So first consider any <m>y \in \bigcup_{x \in A} U_x</m> so that there is an <m>x \in A</m> such that <m>y \in U_x</m>.
            Then clearly also <m>y \in A</m> since <m>U_x \ss A</m>.
            Hence <m>\bigcup_{x \in A} U_x \ss A</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Now consider <m>y \in A</m> so that clearly <m>y \in U_y</m>.
            Then obviously <m>y \in \bigcup_{x \in A} U_x</m> so that
            <m>A \ss \bigcup_{x \in A} U_x</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Thus we have shown that <m>\bigcup_{x \in A} U_x = A</m>,
            and since each <m>U_x</m> is open,
            it follows from the definition of a topology that the union <m>\bigcup_{x \in A} U_x = A</m> is open as well.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the nine topologies on the set
          <m>X = \braces{a,b,c}</m> indicated in Example<nbsp/>1 of &#xa7;12.
          Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies,
          determine whether they are comparable,
          and if so, which is finer.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We label each of the topologies in Figure<nbsp/>12.1 with an ordered pair <m>(i,j)</m> where
          <m>1 \leq i,j \leq 3</m>, <m>i</m> is the row,
          <m>j</m> is the column, and <m>(1,1)</m> is the upper left corner.
          The following matrix lists which of each pair is <em>finer</em>, or
          <q>Inc</q>
          if they are incomparable.

          Show that the collection <m>\cTa</m> given in Example<nbsp/>4 of &#xa7;12 is a topology on <m>X</m>.

            <mrow>\cTi = \braces{U \where X - U \text{ is infinite or empty or all of }  X}</mrow>
          </md>
          a topology on <m>X</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Recall that <m>\cTa</m> from Example<nbsp/>12.4 is the set of all subsets <m>U</m> of <m>X</m> such that <m>X - U</m> either is countable or is all of <m>X</m>.
          First we show that <m>\cTa</m> is a topology on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly <m>\es \in \cTa</m> since <m>X - \es = X</m> is all of <m>X</m>.
            Also <m>X \in \cTa</m> since <m>X - X = \es</m> is countable.
            Now suppose that <m>\cA</m> is a subcollection of <m>\cTa</m> so that <m>X - U</m> is countable
            (or all of <m>X</m>)
            for every <m>U \in \cA</m>.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>X - \bigcup \cA = X - \bigcup_{A \in \cA} A = \bigcap_{A \in \cA} (X - A)</mrow>
            </md>
            is countable
            (or all of <m>X</m>)
            since every <m>X - A</m> is countable
            (or all of <m>X</m>).
            Therefore <m>\bigcup \cA \in \cTa</m> by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>U_1, \ldots, U_n</m> are nonempty elements of <m>\cTa</m> so that <m>X - U_i</m> is a countable subset of <m>X</m> or <m>X</m> itself for each <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>X - \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i = \bigcup_{i=1}^n (X - U_i)</mrow>
            </md>
            is a finite union of sets that are either countable subsets of <m>X</m>,
            or <m>X</m> itself.
            It then follows that the union is countable or <m>X</m> itself so that <m>\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \cTa</m> by definition.
            This completes the proof that <m>\cTa</m> is a topology on <m>X</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we claim that the collection <m>\cTi</m> as defined above is not always a topology on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample,
            let <m>X = \pints</m> and suppose that <m>\cTi</m> is a topology on <m>X</m>.
            Clearly if <m>U</m> is a finite subset of <m>X</m>,
            then <m>X - U</m> is infinite since <m>X</m> is infinite so that <m>U</m> is open.
            Now consider the subcollection
            <md>
              <mrow>\cA = \braces{\braces{i} \where i \in \pints \text{ and }  i > 1} = \braces{\braces{2}, \braces{3}, \ldots} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then clearly we have that <m>\bigcup \cA = \braces{2,3, \ldots}</m> so that <m>X - \bigcup \cA = \braces{1}</m> is neither infinite,
            empty, nor all of <m>X</m>.
            Therefore <m>\bigcup \cA</m> cannot be open,
            which violates property (2) of a topology.
            So it must be that <m>\cTi</m> is not a topology,
            which of course contradicts our supposition that it is!
          </p>

        </ul>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          (a) First we show that <m>\bigcap \cTa</m> is a topology on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly since <m>\es</m> and <m>X</m> are in every <m>\cTa</m> since they are topologies,
            they are both in <m>\bigcap \cTa</m> so that property (1).
            Now suppose that <m>\cA</m> is a subcollection of <m>\bigcap \cTa</m>.
            Consider any <m>\cTb</m> and any <m>A \in \cA</m>.
            Then <m>A</m> is also in <m>\bigcap \cTa</m> since <m>\cA \ss \bigcap \cTa</m>.
            It then follows that <m>A</m> is in our specific <m>\cTb</m>.
            Since <m>A</m> was arbitrary it follows that <m>\cA</m> is a subcollection of <m>\cTb</m> so that
            <m>\bigcup \cA \in \cTb</m> also since <m>\cTb</m> is a topology.
            Since <m>\cTb</m> was also arbitrary it follows that <m>\bigcup \cA \in \bigcap \cTa</m>.
            Lastly, since the subcollection <m>\cA</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows property (2) for <m>\bigcap \cTa</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, suppose that <m>U_1, \ldots, U_n</m> are sets in <m>\bigcap \cTa</m>.
            Consider any <m>\cTb</m> so that clearly then
            <m>U_i \in \cTb</m> for every <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \cTb</m> since <m>\cTb</m> is a topology.
            Since <m>\cTb</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \bigcap \cTa</m>,
            which shows property (3) for <m>\bigcap \cTa</m>.
            This completes the proof that
            <m>\bigcap \cTa</m> is a topology on <m>X</m> since all three properties have been shown.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we claim that <m>\bigcup \cTa</m> is
          <em>not</em> generally a topology.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample consider the set <m>X = \braces{a,b,c}</m>,
            the topologies <m>\cTo = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a}}</m> and <m>\cTt = \braces{\es, X, \braces{b}}</m>,
            and the collection of topologies <m>\col{C} = \braces{\cTo, \cTt}</m>.
            Then we clearly have that <m>\bigcup \col{C} = \cTo \cup \cTt = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a}, \braces{b}}</m>,
            which is not a topology since
            <m>\cA = \braces{\braces{a}, \braces{b}}</m> is a subcollection of <m>\bigcup \col{C}</m> but
            <m>\bigcup \cA = \braces{a,b}</m> is not in <m>\bigcup \col{C}</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) First we show that there is a unique smallest topology that contains each <m>\cTa</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            It was proven in part<nbsp/>(a) that
            <m>\bigcup \cTa</m> is not necessarily a topology.
            However, it is clearly always a subbasis for a topology since clearly
            <m>X \in \bigcup \cTa</m> since it is in each <m>\cTa</m> since they are topologies.
            Hence obviously then <m>\bigcup \parens{\bigcup \cTa} = X</m> so that
            <m>\bigcup \cTa</m> is a subbasis by definition.
            Then let <m>\cTs</m> be the topology generated by the subbasis <m>\bigcup \cTa</m>.
            We claim that <m>\cTs</m> is then the smallest topology that contains all the <m>\cTa</m> as subsets.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, from the proof following the definition of a subbasis,
            we know that the set <m>\cB</m> of finite intersections of elements of
            <m>\bigcup \cTa</m> is a basis for the topology <m>\cTs</m>,
            and that <m>\cTs</m> is the set of all unions of subcollections of <m>\cB</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We first show that every <m>\cTa</m> is indeed contained as a subset of <m>\cTs</m>.
            So consider any specific <m>\cTb</m> and any <m>U \in \cTb</m>.
            Then clearly <m>U \in \bigcup \cTa</m> so that <m>U \in \cB</m> since
            <m>U = \bigcap \braces{U}</m> is a finite intersection of elements of <m>\bigcup \cTa</m>.
            It then follows that <m>U \in \cTs</m> since
            <m>U = \bigcup \braces{U}</m> is the union of a subcollection of <m>\cB</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\cTb \ss \cTs</m>,
            which shows the result since <m>\cTb</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>\cTs</m> is the smallest such topology as ordered by <m>\pss</m>.
            So suppose that <m>\cT</m> is a topology that contains every <m>\cTa</m> as a subset.
            Consider any <m>U \in \cTs</m> so that
            <m>U = \bigcup \cC</m> for some subcollection <m>\cC \ss \cB</m>.
            Now consider any <m>Y \in \cC</m> so that also <m>Y \in \cB</m>.
            Then <m>Y = \bigcap_{i=1}^n Y_i</m> where each <m>Y_i \in \bigcup \cTa</m>.
            Then each <m>Y_i</m> is in some
            <m>\cTb \ss \cT</m> so that also <m>Y_i \in \cT</m>.
            Since <m>\cT</m> is a topology,
            it follows that the finite intersection
            <m>\bigcap_{i=1}^n Y_i = Y</m> is also in <m>\cT</m>.
            Since <m>Y</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\cC \ss \cT</m> so that <m>\cC</m> is a subcollection of <m>\cT</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\bigcup \cC = U</m> is also in <m>\cT</m> since <m>\cT</m> is a topology.
            Since <m>U</m> was arbitrary,
            we have that <m>\cTs \ss \cT</m>,
            which shows that <m>\cTs</m> is the smallest topology since <m>\cT</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to see that <m>\cTs</m> is unique since,
            if both <m>\cTo</m> and <m>\cTs</m> are the smallest topologies that contain each <m>\cTa</m> as subsets,
            then we would have that both <m>\cTo \ss \cTt</m> and
            <m>\cTt \ss \cTo</m> so that <m>\cTo = \cTt</m>.
            Really this follows from the more general fact that smallest elements in any order are always unique.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show that there is a unique largest topology that is contained in each <m>\cTa</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            It was shown in part<nbsp/>(a) that
            <m>\cTl = \bigcap \cTa</m> is a topology on <m>X</m>.
            We claim that in fact this is the unique largest topology contained in all <m>\cTa</m>.
            First, clearly <m>\cTl = \bigcap \cTa</m> is contained in each <m>\cTa</m> since the intersection of a collection of sets is always a subset of every set in the collection.
            Now suppose that <m>\cT</m> is a topology that is contained in every <m>\cTa</m>, i.e.
            <m>\cT \ss \cTa</m> for every <m>\cTa</m>.
            Then clearly for any <m>U \in \cT</m> we have that
            <m>U \in \cTa</m> for every <m>\cTa</m> so that <m>U \in \bigcap \cTa = \cTl</m>.
            Thus <m>\cT \ss \cTl</m> since <m>U</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>\cTl</m> is the largest such topology since <m>\cT</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly also <m>\cTl</m> is unique since,
            if <m>\cTo</m> and <m>\cTt</m> are two such largest topologies that are contained in every <m>\cTa</m>.
            Then we would have <m>\cTo \ss \cTt</m> and
            <m>\cTt \ss \cTo</m> so that <m>\cTo = \cTt</m>.
            This also follows from the fact that the largest element in any ordered set
            (or collection of sets in this case)
            is unique.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c) Note that the proofs in part<nbsp/>(b) are constructive so that we can construct these topologies as done in the proof.
          For the smallest topology containing <m>\cTo</m> and <m>\cTt</m> we have that
          <md>
            <mrow>\bigcup \braces{\cTo, \cTt} = \cTo \cup \cTt = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a}, \braces{a,b}, \braces{b,c}}</mrow>
          </md>
          is a subbasis for the smallest topology <m>\cTs</m>.
          Then the collection of all finite intersections of elements of this set is a basis for <m>\cTs</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>\cB = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a}, \braces{b}, \braces{a,b}, \braces{b,c}} \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the topology <m>\cTs</m> is the set of all unions of subcollections of <m>\cB</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>\cTs = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a}, \braces{b}, \braces{a,b}, \braces{b,c}} = \cB</mrow>
          </md>
          so that evidently the basis and the topology are the same set here!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the largest topology contained in <m>\cTo</m> and <m>\cTt</m> we have simply
          <md>
            <mrow>\cTl = \bigcap \braces{\cTo, \cTt} = \cTo \cap \cTt = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a}} \,</mrow>

          then the topology generated by <m>\cA</m> equals the intersection of all topologies on <m>X</m> that contain <m>\cA</m>.
          Prove the same if <m>\cA</m> is a subbasis.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>\cT</m> is the topology generated by basis <m>\cA</m>,
          and <m>\cC</m> is the collection of topologies on <m>X</m> that contain <m>\cA</m> as a subset.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we show that <m>\cT = \bigcap \cC</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider <m>U \in \cT</m> and any
            <m>\cT_c \in \cC</m> so that <m>\cA \ss \cT_c</m>.
            Then, since <m>\cA</m> generates <m>\cT</m>,
            it follows from Lemma<nbsp/>13.1 that <m>U</m> is the union of elements of <m>\cA</m>.
            Clearly then each of these elements of <m>\cA</m> is in <m>\cT_c</m> since
            <m>\cA \ss \cT_c</m> so that their union is as well since <m>\cT_c</m> is a topology.
            Hence <m>U \in \cT_c</m> so that
            <m>\cT \ss \cT_c</m> since <m>U</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence <m>\cT</m> is contained in all elements of <m>\cC</m> so that <m>\cT \ss \bigcap \cC</m>.
            Also, clearly <m>\cT</m> is a topology that contains <m>\cA</m> so that <m>\cT \in \cC</m>.
            Clearly then <m>\bigcap \cC \ss \cT</m> so that <m>\cT = \bigcap \cC</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show the same thing but when <m>\cA</m> is a subbasis.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\cB</m> be the set of all finite intersections of elements of <m>\cA</m>,
            which we know is a basis for <m>\cT</m> by the proof after the definition of a subbasis.
            We show that <m>\cB \ss \cT_c</m> for all <m>\cT_c \in \cC</m>.
            So consider any set <m>B \in \cB</m> so that <m>B</m> is the finite intersection of elements of <m>\cA</m>.
            Also consider any <m>\cT_c \in \cC</m> so that each of these elements is in <m>\cT_c</m> since <m>\cA \ss \cT_c</m>.
            Since <m>\cT_c</m> is a topology,
            clearly the finite intersection of these elements, i.e.
            <m>B</m>, is in <m>\cT_c</m>.
            Hence <m>\cB \ss \cT_c</m> since <m>B</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows from what was shown before that
            <m>\cT = \bigcap \cC</m> since <m>\cT</m> is the topology generated by the basis <m>\cB</m> and <m>\cB</m> is contained in each topology in <m>\cC</m>.

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\cT_l</m> and <m>\cT_K</m> be the topologies of
            <m>\reals_l</m> and <m>\reals_K</m>, respectively.

            Let <m>B_K</m> be any basis element of <m>\cB_K</m> that contains <m>0</m>.
            Then <m>B_K</m> is either <m>(a,b)</m> or
            <m>(a,b) - K</m> for some <m>a \lt  b</m>.
            In either case it must be that
            <m>a \lt  0 \lt  b</m> so that clearly <m>a \lt  a/2 \lt  0 \lt  b</m>.
            Also <m>a/2 \notin K</m> since <m>a/2 \lt  0</m> so that we have

            <m>B_l = \clop{a,b}</m> where <m>a \leq 0 \lt  b</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>1/b > 0</m> and there is an
            <m>n \in \pints</m> where <m>n > 1/b</m> since the positive integers have no upper bound.
            We then have
            <md>
              <mrow>0 \amp \lt  1/b \lt  n</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \amp \lt  1 \lt  bn \amp  \text{ (since \(b > 0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \amp \lt  1/n \lt  b \amp  \text{ (since \(n > 1/b > 0\)) }</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>1/n \in \clop{0,b} = B_l</m>.
            However, clearly <m>1/n \in K</m> so that <m>1/n \notin (-1,1) - K = B_K</m>.
            Hence it must be that <m>B_l \nss B_K</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cT_l</m> is not finer than <m>\cT_K</m> by the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 as before.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the proof that <m>\cT_K</m> and <m>\cT_l</m> are not comparable.

          Let <m>\cB_1</m>, <m>\cB_2</m>, <m>\cB_4</m>,
          and <m>\cB_5</m> be the given bases corresponding to the above topologies,
          noting that <m>\cT_3</m> is defined directly rather than generated from a basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we show that <m>\cT_3 \pss \cT_1</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>U \in \cT_3</m> so that
            <m>\reals - U</m> is finite or <m>U = \reals</m>.
            Clearly in the latter case
            <m>U \in \cT_1</m> since it is a topology.
            In the former case <m>\reals - U</m> is a finite set of real numbers so that its elements can be enumerated as
            <m>\braces{x_1, x_2, \ldots,
            x_n}</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m> where <m>x_1 \lt  x_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  x_n</m>.
            Then clearly we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>U = (-\infty, x_1) \cup \squares{\bigcup_{k=1}^{n-1} (x_k, x_{k+1})} \cup (x_n, \infty) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of these sets is an interval <m>(a,b)</m> or the union of such intervals.
            For example, the set <m>(-\infty,
            x_1)</m> can be covered by the countable union of intervals
            <md>
              <mrow>\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (x_1 - k - 1, x_1 - k + 1)</mrow>
            </md>
            and similarly for the interval <m>(x_n, \infty)</m>.
            Hence the union <m>U</m> is an element of <m>\cT_1</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.1.
            Since <m>U</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\cT_3 \ss \cT_1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, clearly the interval <m>(-1, 1)</m> is in <m>\cT_1</m> since it is a basis element.
            However, we also have that
            <m>\reals - (-1,1) = \opcl{-\infty, -1} \cup \clop{1, \infty}</m> is neither finite nor all of <m>\reals</m>.
            Hence <m>(-1, 1) \notin \cT_3</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cT_1</m> cannot be a subset of <m>\cT_3</m> so that <m>\cT_3 \pss \cT_1</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show that <m>\cT_5 \pss \cT_1</m> also.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in \reals</m> and any basis element <m>B_5 \in \cB_5</m> containing <m>x</m>.
            Then <m>B_5 = (-\infty, a)</m> where <m>x \lt a</m>.
            Let <m>B_1 = (x-1, a)</m>, which is a basis element in <m>\cB_1</m>.
            Also clearly <m>B_1</m> contains <m>x</m> and is a subset of <m>B_5</m>.
            This proves that <m>\cT_5 \ss \cT_1</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider <m>x = -1</m> and basis element <m>B_1 = (-2, 0)</m> in <m>\cB_1</m>,
            noting that obviously <m>x \in B_1</m>,
            and hence <m>-2 \lt x \lt 0</m>.
            Let <m>B_5</m> be any element of <m>\cB_5</m> containing <m>x</m> so that
            <m>B_5 = (-\infty,
            a)</m> where <m>x \lt a</m>.
            Clearly then <m>-3 \lt -2 \lt x \lt a</m> so that <m>-3 \in B_5</m>.
            However, since <m>-3 \notin (-2, 0) = B_1</m>,
            this shows that <m>B_5 \nss B_1</m>.
            This suffices to show that
            <m>\cT_1 \nss \cT_5</m> by the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            Therefore <m>\cT_5 \pss \cT_1</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we show that <m>\cT_3</m> and <m>\cT_5</m> are not comparable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider the set <m>U = \realsnz</m> so that
            <m>U \in \cT_3</m> since <m>\reals - U = \braces{0}</m> is obviously finite.
            Now suppose that <m>U \in \cT_5</m> as well.
            Then, since clearly <m>1 \in U</m>,
            there must be a basis element
            <m>B_5 \in \cB_5</m> where <m>1 \in B_5</m> and
            <m>B_5 \ss U</m> by the definition of a topological basis.
            Then <m>B_5 = (-\infty, a)</m> where <m>1 \lt a</m>.
            However, since <m>0 \lt 1 \lt a</m> as well,
            it must be that <m>0 \in B_5</m>,
            and hence <m>0 \in U</m> since <m>B_5 \ss U</m>.
            As this clearly contradicts the definition of <m>U</m>,
            it has to be that <m>U</m> is not in fact in <m>\cT_5</m> so that <m>\cT_3 \nss \cT_5</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider the set <m>U = (-\infty, 0)</m>,
            which is clearly in <m>\cT_5</m> since it is a basis element.
            However, since <m>\reals - U = \clop{0, \infty}</m> is clearly neither all of <m>\reals</m> nor finite,
            it follows that <m>U \notin \cT_3</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cT_5 \nss \cT_3</m>,
            which completes the proof that the two are incomparable.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now, the fact that <m>\cT_1 \pss \cT_2</m> was shown in Lemma<nbsp/>13.4.
          All that remains to be shown is that
          <m>\cT_2 \pss \cT_4</m> since the rest of the relations follow from the transitivity of proper inclusion.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any basis element
            <m>B_2 \in \cB_2</m> and any <m>x \in B_2</m>.
            Either <m>B_2</m> is <m>(a,b)</m> or
            <m>(a,b) - K</m> for <m>a \lt b</m> so that
            <m>a \lt x \lt b</m> with <m>x \notin K</m>.
            In the former case clearly the set <m>B_4 = \opcl{a,x}</m> is in <m>\cB_4</m>,
            <m>x \in B_4</m>, and <m>B_4 \ss B_2</m>.
            In the latter case we have the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \leq 0</m>.
            Then here again <m>B_4 = \opcl{a,x}</m> is in <m>\cB_4</m>,
            <m>x \in B_4</m>,
            and <m>B_4 \ss B_2</m> since <m>y \notin K</m> for any
            <m>y \in B_4</m> since then <m>a \lt y \leq x \leq 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x > 0</m>.
            Then let <m>n</m> be the smallest positive integer where <m>n > 1/x</m>,
            which exists since <m>\pints</m> has no upper bound and is well-ordered.
            It then follows that <m>0 \lt 1/n \lt x</m> and there are no integers <m>m</m> such that <m>1/n \lt 1/m \leq x</m>.
            So let <m>a' = \max(a, 1/n)</m> and set
            <m>B_4 = \opcl{a', x}</m> so that, for any <m>y \in B_4</m>,
            both <m>a \leq a' \lt y \leq x \lt b</m> and <m>1/n \leq a' \lt y \lt x</m>,
            and hence <m>y \in (a,b)</m> and <m>y \notin K</m>.
            Therefore <m>y \in (a,b) - K = B_2</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>B_4 \ss B_2</m>,
            noting that also clearly <m>x \in B_4</m> and <m>B_4 \in \cB_4</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in any case it follows that
            <m>\cT_2 \ss \cT_4</m> from Lemma<nbsp/>3.13.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>x = -1</m> and <m>B_4 = \opcl{-2, -1}</m> so that clearly
            <m>x \in B_4</m> and <m>B_4 \in \cB_4</m>.
            Then let <m>B_2</m> be any basis element in <m>\cB_2</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
            Then we have that <m>B_2</m> is either <m>(a,b)</m> or <m>(a,b) - K</m> where
            <m>a \lt x \lt b</m> and <m>x \notin K</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>0 \lt b</m>.
            Then <m>a \lt x = -1 \lt 0 \leq b</m> so that <m>0</m> is in both <m>(a,b)</m> and
            <m>(a,b) - K</m> since clearly <m>0 \notin K</m>,
            and thus <m>0 \in B_2</m>.
            However, clearly <m>0 \notin \opcl{-2,-1} = B_4</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>0 \geq b</m>.
            Then <m>a \lt x \lt (x+b)/2 \lt b \leq 0</m> so that
            <m>(x+b)/2 \in B_2</m> since <m>(x+b)/2</m> is not in <m>K</m>.
            Clearly also though <m>(x+b)/2 \notin \opcl{-2, x} = B_4</m> since <m>x \lt (x+b)/2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in either case we have that <m>B_2 \nss B_4</m>.
            This shows the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 so that <m>\cT_4 \nss \cT_2</m>.
            Hence <m>\cT_2 \pss \cT_4</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\cT</m> be the standard topology on <m>\reals</m>.
            First, clearly <m>\cB</m> is a collection of open sets of <m>\cT</m> since each element is a basis element in the standard basis (i.e. an open interval).
            Now consider any <m>U \in \cT</m> and any <m>x \in U</m>.
            Then there is a standard basis element
            <m>B' = (a',b')</m> such that <m>x \in B'</m> and
            <m>B' \ss U</m> since <m>\cT</m> is generated by the standard basis.
            Then <m>a' \lt x \lt b'</m> so that,
            since the rationals are order-dense in the reals (shown in Exercise<nbsp/>4.9 part<nbsp/>(d)),
            there are rational <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> such that <m>a' \lt a \lt x \lt b \lt b'</m>.
            Let <m>B = (a, b)</m> so that clearly <m>x \in B</m>,
            <m>B \ss B' \ss U</m>, and <m>B \in \cB</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cB</m> is a basis for <m>\cT</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.2 since <m>U</m> and <m>x \in U</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we must show that <m>\cC</m> is a basis at all.
            Clearly, for any <m>x \in \reals</m> we have that there is an element in <m>\cC</m> containing <m>x</m>,
            for example <m>\clop{x, x+1}</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>C_1 = \clop{a_1, b_1}</m> and
            <m>C_2 = \clop{a_2, b_2}</m> are two elements of <m>\cC</m> and that <m>x \in C_1 \cap C_2</m>.
            Then obviously <m>a_1 \leq x \lt b_1</m> and <m>a_2 \leq x \lt b_2</m>.
            Let <m>a = \max(a_1, a_2)</m> and <m>b = \min(b_1, b_2)</m> and
            <m>C = \clop{a,b}</m> so that clearly <m>C \in \cC</m>.
            Also clearly <m>a \leq x \lt b</m> since both
            <m>a_1 \leq x \lt b_1</m> and <m>a_2 \leq x \lt b_2</m>,
            <m>a</m> is <m>a_1</m> or <m>a_2</m>,
            and <m>b</m> is <m>b_1</m> or <m>b_2</m>.
            Therefore <m>C</m> contains <m>x</m>.
            Now consider any <m>y \in C</m> so that
            <m>a_1 \leq a \leq y \lt b \leq b_1</m> and <m>a_2 \leq a \leq y \lt b \leq b_2</m> and hence
            <m>y \in C_1</m> and <m>y \in C_2</m>.
            This shows that <m>C \ss C_1 \cap C_2</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            By definition this suffices to show that <m>\cC</m> is a basis for a topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let <m>\cT</m> be the topology generated by <m>\cC</m> and <m>\cT_l</m> be the lower limit topology.
            Now consider <m>U = \clop{x, x+1}</m> where <m>x</m> is any irrational number,
            for example <m>x = \pi</m>.
            Let <m>C</m> be any basis element in <m>\cC</m> containing <m>x</m> so that
            <m>C = \clop{a,b}</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are rational.
            It must be that <m>a \neq x</m> since <m>a</m> is rational but <m>x</m> is not.
            Also, since <m>C</m> contains <m>x</m> it has to be that <m>a \leq x</m>.
            So it has to be that <m>a \lt  x</m>,
            but then <m>a \in C</m> but <m>a \notin \clop{x, x+1} = U</m>.
            This shows that <m>C</m> is not a subset of <m>U</m>.
            Hence we have shown
            <md>
              <mrow>\exists x \in U \forall C \in \cC \parens{x \in C \imp C \nss U}</mrow>
              <mrow>\exists x \in U \forall C \in \cC \parens{x \notin C \lor C \nss U}</mrow>
              <mrow>\lnot \forall x \in U \exists C \in \cC \parens{x \in C \land C \ss U} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>U \notin \cT</m> by the definition of a generated topology.
            However, clearly we have that
            <m>U \in \cT_l</m> since it is a lower limit basis element.
            This suffices to show that <m>\cT</m> and <m>\cT_l</m> are different topologies.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>Y</m> is a subspace of <m>X</m> and <m>A</m> is a subspace of <m>Y</m>,
          then the topology <m>A</m> inherits as a subspace of <m>Y</m> is the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\cT</m> be the topology on <m>X</m> and <m>\cT_Y</m> be the subspace topology that <m>Y</m> inherits from <m>X</m>.
            Also let <m>\cT_A</m> and <m>\cT_A'</m> be the topologies that <m>A</m> inherits as a subspace of <m>Y</m> and <m>X</m>,
            respectively.
            Therefore we must show that <m>\cT_A = \cT_A'</m>.
            Now, by definition of subspace topologies we have that,
            <md>
              <mrow>\cT_Y \amp = \braces{Y \cap U \where U \in \cT} \amp \cT_A \amp = \braces{A \cap U \where U \in \cT_Y} \amp \cT_A' \amp = \braces{A \cap U \where U \in \cT} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>W \in \cT_A</m> so that
            <m>W = A \cap V</m> for some <m>V \in \cT_Y</m>.
            Then we have that <m>V = Y \cap U</m> for some <m>U \in \cT</m>,
            and hence
            <md>
              <mrow>W = A \cap V = A \cap (Y \cap U) = (A \cap Y) \cap U = A \cap U</mrow>
            </md>
            since we have that <m>A \cap Y = A</m> since <m>A \ss Y</m>.
            Since <m>U \in \cT</m> this clearly shows that <m>W \in \cT_A'</m> so that
            <m>\cT_A \ss \cT_A'</m> since <m>W</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, for any <m>W \in \cT_A'</m>,
            we have that <m>W = A \cap U</m> for some <m>U \in \cT</m>.
            Let <m>V = Y \cap U</m> so that clearly <m>V \in \cT_Y</m>.
            Then as before we have that
            <m>A = A \cap Y</m> since <m>A \ss Y</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>W = A \cap U = (A \cap Y) \cap U = A \cap (Y \cap U) = A \cap V \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and thus <m>W \in \cT_A</m> since <m>V \in \cT_Y</m>.
            Since <m>W</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>\cT_A' \ss \cT_A</m>,
            which completes the proof that <m>\cT_A = \cT_A'</m>.

          If <m>\cT</m> and <m>\cT'</m> are topologies on <m>X</m> and <m>\cT'</m> is strictly finer than <m>\cT</m>,

        <p>
          Let <m>\cT_Y</m> and <m>\cT_Y'</m> be the subspace topologies on <m>Y</m> corresponding to <m>\cT</m> and <m>\cT'</m>,
          respectively.
          We claim that <m>\cT_Y</m> is finer than <m>\cT_Y</m> but not necessarily strictly finer.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\cT_Y \amp = \braces{Y \cap U \where U \in \cT} \amp \cT_Y' \amp = \braces{Y \cap U \where U \in \cT'}</mrow>
            </md>
            by the definition of subspace topologies.
            So for any <m>V \in \cT_Y</m> we have that
            <m>V = Y \cap U</m> where <m>U \in \cT</m>.
            Then also <m>U \in \cT'</m> since <m>\cT'</m> is finer than <m>\cT</m>.
            This shows that <m>V \in \cT_Y'</m> since
            <m>V = Y \cap U</m> where <m>U \in \cT'</m>.
            Hence <m>\cT_Y'</m> is finer than <m>\cT_Y</m> since <m>V</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is not necessarily strictly finer,
            consider the sets <m>X = \braces{a,b,c}</m> and
            <m>Y = \braces{a,b}</m> so that clearly <m>Y \ss X</m>.
            Consider also the topologies
            <md>
              <mrow>\cT \amp = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a,b}} \amp \cT' \amp = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a,b}, \braces{c}}</mrow>
            </md>
            on <m>X</m> so that clearly <m>\cT'</m> is strictly finer than <m>\cT</m>.
            This results in the subspace topologies
            <md>
              <mrow>\cT_Y \amp = \braces{\es, Y} \amp \cT_Y' \amp = \braces{\es, Y} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which are clearly the same so that <m>\cT_Y'</m> is not strictly finer than <m>\cT_Y'</m>,
            noting that it is technically still finer.
            However, if we instead have the topologies
            <md>
              <mrow>\cT \amp = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a,b}} \amp \cT' \amp = \braces{\es, X, \braces{a,b}, \braces{b}}</mrow>
            </md>
            then
            <md>
              <mrow>\cT_Y \amp = \braces{\es, Y} \amp \cT_Y' \amp = \braces{\es, Y, \braces{b}}</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\cT_Y'</m> <em>is</em>
            strictly finer than <m>\cT_Y</m>.
            Thus we can say nothing about the strictness of relation of the subspace topologies.

        <proof>
          <p>
            We prove only the first of these as the rest follow from nearly identical arguments.
            Let <m>A = \braces{x \in \reals \where a \lt \abs{x} \lt b}</m> and
            <m>B = (-b, -a) \cup (a, b)</m> so that we must show that <m>A = B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>a \lt \abs{x} \lt b</m>.
            If <m>x \geq 0</m> then <m>\abs{x} = x</m> so that
            <m>a \lt x \lt b</m> and hence <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
            If <m>x \lt 0</m> then <m>\abs{x} = -x</m> so that <m>a \lt -x \lt b</m>,
            and thus <m>-a > x > -b</m> so that <m>x \in (-b, -a)</m>.
            Thus in either case <m>x \in B</m> so that <m>A \ss B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>x \in B</m> so that either
            <m>x \in (-b,-a)</m> or <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
            In the former case we have that <m>x \lt  -a \leq 0</m> since
            <m>a \geq 0</m> so that <m>\abs{x} = -x</m> and therefore

          <p>
            In the latter case we have that
            <m>x > a \geq 0</m> so that <m>\abs{x} = x</m> and therefore
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in (a, b) \imp a \lt  x = \abs{x} \lt  b \imp x \in A \,</mrow>

        </p>
        <p>
          First we claim that <m>A</m> is open in both <m>\reals</m> and <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We have from <xref ref="lem_subset_abs">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>A = (-1, -\oh) \cup (\oh, 1)</m> which is clearly the union of basis elements so that <m>A</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>.
            We also have that <m>A \ss Y</m> so that <m>A</m> is open in <m>Y</m> by <xref ref="lem_subset_open">Lemma</xref>
            since it is open in <m>\reals</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we claim that <m>B</m> is open in <m>Y</m> but not in <m>\reals</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            By <xref ref="lem_subset_abs">Lemmma</xref>
            we have that <m>B = \clop{-1, -\oh} \cup \opcl{\oh, 1}</m>.
            First, consider the sets <m>(-2,-\oh)</m> and <m>(\oh,2)</m>,
            which are clearly both basis elements and therefore open in <m>\reals</m>.
            We then have that <m>(-2,-\oh) \cap Y = \clop{-1,-\oh}</m> and
            <m>(\oh,2) \cap Y = \opcl{\oh, 1}</m> so that these sets are open in <m>Y</m> by the definition of the subspace topology.
            Clearly then their union <m>B = \clop{-1, -\oh} \cup \opcl{\oh, 1}</m> is then also open in <m>Y</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also easy to see that <m>B</m> is not open in <m>\reals</m>.
            For example, <m>-1 \in B</m> but for any basis element
            <m>B' = (a,b)</m> containing <m>-1</m> we have that <m>a \lt -1 \lt b</m> so that
            <m>a \lt (a-1)/2 \lt -1 \lt b</m> and hence <m>(a-1)/2 \in B'</m>.
            Clearly though <m>(a-1)/2 \notin B</m> so that <m>B'</m> cannot be a subset of <m>B</m>.
            Thus suffices to show that <m>B</m> is not open by the definition of the topology of <m>\reals</m> generated by its basis.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>C</m> is open neither in <m>\reals</m> nor <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            By <xref ref="lem_subset_abs">Lemmma</xref>
            we have that <m>C = \opcl{-1,-\oh} \cup \clop{\oh, 1}</m>.
            If <m>\cB</m> is the standard basis on <m>\reals</m>, then,
            by Lemma<nbsp/>16.1, the set
            <m>\cB_Y = \braces{B \cap Y \where B \in \cB}</m> is a basis for the subspace <m>Y</m>.
            So consider the point <m>x = \oh</m> and any basis element <m>B_Y \in \cB_Y</m> containing <m>x</m>.
            Then we have that <m>B_Y = Y \cap B_X</m> for some basis element <m>B_X = (a,b)</m> in <m>\cB</m>,
            and thus <m>a \lt  x \lt  b</m> since <m>x \in B_X</m>.
            Let <m>a' = \max(a, -\oh)</m> and set <m>y = (a'+x)/2</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>a \leq a' \lt  (a'+x)/2 = y \lt  x \lt  b \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and hence <m>y \in (a,b) = B_X</m>.
            Also we have
            <md>
              <mrow>-1 \lt  -\oh \leq a' \lt  (a'+x)/2 = y \lt  x = \oh \lt  1</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>y \in [-1,1] = Y</m>.
            Therefore <m>y \in Y \cap B_X = B_Y</m>.
            However, since <m>-\oh \lt  y \lt  \oh</m>,
            clearly <m>y \notin C</m> so that <m>B_Y</m> cannot be a subset of <m>C</m>.
            Since the basis element <m>B_Y \in \cB_Y</m> was arbitrary,
            this suffices to show that <m>C</m> cannot be open in <m>Y</m> since <m>\cB_Y</m> is a basis.
            Since also clearly <m>C \ss Y</m>,
            it follows from the contrapositive of <xref ref="lem_subset_open">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>C</m> is not open in <m>\reals</m> either.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we claim that <m>D</m> is also not open in <m>\reals</m> or <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            This follows from basically the same argument as the previous proof,
            again using the point <m>x = \oh</m> to show that any basis element of <m>Y</m> that contains <m>x</m> cannot be a subset of <m>D</m>.
          </p>

          Lastly, we claim that <m>E</m> is open in both <m>\reals</m> and <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it is trivial to show that
            <md>
              <mrow>E = \braces{x \in \reals \where 0 \lt  \abs{x} \lt  1} - K = \squares{(-1,0) \cup (0,1)} - K \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where we have used <xref ref="lem_subset_abs">Lemma</xref>.
            Now consider any <m>x \in E</m> so that
            <m>x \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)</m> and <m>x \notin K</m>.
            If <m>x \in (-1,0)</m> then clearly the basis element <m>(-1,0)</m> contains <m>x</m> and is a subset of <m>E</m> since <m>(-1,0) \cap K = \es</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if <m>x \in (0,1)</m> then
            <m>x \notin K</m> so that <m>1/x \notin \pints</m>.
            From this it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.9 part<nbsp/>(b) that there is exactly one positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n \lt 1/x \lt n+1</m>.
            We then have that <m>1/(n+1) \lt x \lt 1/n</m>.
            So let <m>B = (1/(n+1), 1/n)</m> so that clearly <m>x \in B</m>,
            <m>B \cap K = \es</m>,
            and <m>B</m> is a basis element of the standard topology on <m>\reals</m>.
            Since <m>B \cap K = \es</m> and clearly <m>0 \lt 1/(n+1) \lt 1/n \leq 1</m>,
            it also follows that <m>B \ss E</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in either case there is a basis element of <m>\reals</m> that contains <m>x</m> and is a subset of <m>E</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>E</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>.
            Since clearly <m>E \ss Y</m>,
            we also clearly have that <m>E</m> is open in <m>Y</m> by <xref ref="lem_subset_open">Lemma</xref>.

          A map <m>f: X \to Y</m> is said to be an

          the set <m>f(U)</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.
          Show that <m>\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X</m> and <m>\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y</m> are open maps.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>U</m> is an open subset of <m>X \times Y</m>.
            Consider any <m>x \in \pi_1(U)</m> so that there is a <m>y \in Y</m> such that <m>(x,y) \in U</m>.
            Then there is a basis element
            <m>A \times B</m> of the product topology on
            <m>X \times Y</m> where <m>(x,y) \in A \times B \ss U</m>.
            Then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are open sets of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>,
            respectively,
            since <m>A \times B</m> is a basis element of the product topology.
            Clearly we have that <m>x \in A</m> since <m>(x,y) \in A \times B</m>.
            Now, for any <m>x' \in A</m>,
            we have that <m>(x',y) \in A \times B</m> so that <m>(x',y) \in U</m>.
            Hence <m>x' = \pi_1(x',y) \in \pi_1(U)</m>,
            which shows that <m>A \ss \pi_1(U)</m> since <m>x'</m> was arbitrary.
            Then, since <m>A</m> is an open subset of <m>X</m>,
            there is a basis element <m>A'</m> where <m>x \in A' \ss A \ss \pi_1(U)</m>.
            This suffices to show that
            <m>\pi_1(U)</m> is an open subset of <m>X</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            An analogous argument shows that <m>\pi_2</m> is also an open map.

          (a)

        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>W \in \cT_p</m> and any <m>(x,y) \in W</m>,
            noting that obviously <m>W \ss X \times Y</m>.
            Then there is a basis element
            <m>U \times V</m> of <m>\cT_p</m> such that
            <m>(x,y) \in U \times V</m> and <m>U \times V \ss W</m>.
            By the definition of the product topology,
            we have that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are open sets in <m>\cT</m> and <m>\cU</m>,
            respectively.
            Then we also have that <m>U \in \cT'</m> and <m>V \in \cU'</m> since
            <m>\cT \ss \cT'</m> and <m>\cU \ss \cU'</m>.
            Hence <m>U \times V</m> is also a basis element of <m>\cT_p'</m>.
            Since we know that <m>(x,y) \in U \times V</m>,
            <m>U \times V \ss W</m>, and <m>(x,y) \in W</m> was arbitrary,
            this suffices to show that <m>W</m> is an open subset of
            <m>X' \times Y'</m> and hence <m>W \in \cT_p'</m>.
            This in turn shows that <m>\cT_p \ss \cT_p'</m> since <m>W</m> was arbitrary.

            Since their bases are the same,

            We claim that <m>Y</m> is convex but not an interval or a ray.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, consider <m>a,b \in Y</m> where <m>a \lt b</m>,
            thus <m>a^2,b^2 \lt 2</m>.
            Also consider <m>x \in (a,b)</m> so that <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>.
            If <m>x \geq 0</m> then <m>0 \leq x \lt b</m> so that <m>x^2 \lt b^2 \lt 2</m>.
            If <m>x \lt 0</m> then <m>a \lt x \lt 0</m> so that <m>2 > a^2 > x^2</m>.
            Thus in either case <m>x^2 \lt 2</m> so that <m>x \in Y</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>(a,b) \ss Y</m> so that <m>Y</m> is convex since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, clearly <m>Y</m> cannot be a ray with no lower bound since then there would be an <m>x</m> in the ray where <m>x \lt -2</m> so that
            <m>x^2 > 4 > 2</m> and hence <m>x \notin Y</m>.
            Similarly <m>Y</m> cannot be a ray with no upper bound since then the ray would contain an <m>x > 2</m> so that
            <m>x^2 > 4 > 2</m> and thus <m>x \notin Y</m>.
            So suppose that <m>Y = [a,b]</m> for some
            <m>a,b \in X = \rats</m> where <m>a \leq b</m>.
            Now, it cannot be that <m>b^2 = 2</m> since then
            <m>b = \sqrt{2}</m>, which is not rational.
            Similarly it cannot be that <m>a^2 = 2</m> for the same reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b^2 \lt 2</m>.
            Then there is a rational <m>p</m> where
            <m>b \lt p \lt \sqrt{2}</m> since the rationals are order-dense in the reals.
            Let <m>x = \max(0, p)</m> so that
            <m>b \lt p \leq x</m> and hence <m>x \notin [a,b]</m>.
            However, if <m>0 \lt p</m> then <m>x = p</m> so that <m>x^2 = p^2 \lt 2</m>,
            and if <m>0 \geq p</m> then <m>x = 0</m> so that <m>x^2 = 0 \lt 2</m>.
            Thus either way <m>x \in Y</m> and <m>x \notin [a,b]</m>,
            which shows that <m>Y</m> cannot be <m>[a,b]</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b^2 > 2</m>.
            Then <m>\sqrt{2} \lt b</m> since <m>0 \lt 2 \lt b^2</m>.
            If <m>\sqrt{2} \lt a</m> then clearly for any
            <m>x \in [a,b]</m> we have that <m>0 \lt \sqrt{2} \lt a \leq x</m> so that
            <m>2 \lt x^2</m> and hence <m>x \notin Y</m>.
            If <m>a \lt \sqrt{2}</m> then there is a rational <m>p</m> such that
            <m>a \lt \sqrt{2} \lt p \lt b</m> since the rationals are order-dense in the reals.
            Hence <m>2 \lt p^2</m> so that <m>p \notin Y</m>.
            Either way there is an <m>x \in [a,b]</m> where
            <m>x \notin Y</m> so that <m>Y</m> cannot be <m>[a,b]</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar arguments show that neither
            <m>Y = (a,b)</m>, <m>Y = \clop{a,b}</m>,
            nor <m>Y = \opcl{a,b}</m> for <m>a,b \in X = \rats</m> and <m>a \lt b</m>.
            Hence <m>Y</m> cannot be an interval.
            Thus <m>Y</m> is convex but neither an interval nor a ray in <m>X</m>.

          Also let $\reals_d$ denote the reals with the discrete topology,
          which can clearly be generated by a basis containing intervals <m>[a,b]</m> for <m>a \leq b</m>.
          This is easy to see as <m>[a,a] = \braces{a}</m> is a basis element so that any subset of <m>\reals</m> can be considered a union of such basis elements.
          It is then easy to show that $\reals_\ell$ and $\reals_u$ are both strictly finer than the standard topology on <m>\reals</m>
          (this was shown in Lemma<nbsp/>13.4 for $\reals_\ell$),
          but that $\reals_\ell$ and $\reals_u$ are incomparable.

          so we will have to discuss this informally.
          We can see that, in some sense,
          a line <m>L</m> in the plane is like a copy of the real line so that we can discuss topologies on <m>L</m> is being in some sense the same as topologies on <m>\reals</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The product topology <m>\realsl \times \reals</m> is the topology is generated by the basis containing sets of the form
          <m>\clop{a,b} \times (c,d)</m> where <m>a \lt  b</m> and
          <m>c \lt  d</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>15.1.
          Then, for a line <m>L</m> in the plane,
          it can intersect such a basis element in a variety of ways,
          which are illustrated below:
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ (a) }  \amp  \linebe{0,0.5}{1,0.5} \amp \text{ (b) }  \amp  \linebe{0.5,0}{0.5,1} \amp \text{ (c) }  \amp  \linebe{0,0.2}{0.8,1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\text{ (d) }  \amp  \linebe{0.20,0}{1,0.8} \amp \text{ (e) }  \amp  \linebe{0,0.8}{0.8,0} \amp \text{ (f) }  \amp  \linebe{0.2,1}{1,0.2}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly the intersection of <m>L</m> and these basis elements results in some kind of interval on <m>L</m>.
          Such intervals then form the basis for the subspace topology on <m>L</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>16.1 since they are the intersection of <m>L</m> and a basis element in the superspace.
          Another point is that the orientation of the line <m>L</m> with regard to the way in which it is a copy of <m>\reals</m> is important.
          For example, in Figure<nbsp/>(a) above,
          if <m>L</m> is oriented in the natural way with the negative reals on the left and the positive reals on the right,
          then the resulting intervals are of the form <m>\clop{a,b}</m>,
          which would result in a topology like $\reals_\ell$. The opposite orientation results in intervals of the form <m>\opcl{a,b}</m> as basis elements,
          generating a topology like $\reals_u$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, for a line <m>L</m> such as that illustrated in Figure<nbsp/>(a),
          every possible basis element of
          <m>\realsl \times \reals</m> that intersects <m>L</m> results the half-open intervals as described above depending on the orientation of <m>L</m>.
          This is not the case for all lines,
          however, and is dependent on its slope in the plane.
          For example,
          lines with positive slope can intersect basis elements as in Figure<nbsp/>(c),
          which result in half open intervals <m>\clop{a,b}</m>
          (or <m>\opcl{a,b}</m> depending on orientation),
          or they can intersect them as in Figure<nbsp/>(d),
          which result in open intervals <m>(a,b)</m>.
          However, since the topologies $\reals_\ell$ and $\reals_u$ are strictly finer than the standard topology,
          the subspace topology formed on <m>L</m> would be like these
          (which depends on orientation)
          rather than like the standard topology.
          Lastly, we note that, for any appropriate interval on the line <m>L</m>,
          we can clearly always find a basis element <m>B</m> in
          <m>\realsl \times \reals</m> such that the intersection of <m>B</m> with <m>L</m> is the interval.
          For this reason,
          these intervals form the basis elements of the topology on <m>L</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all these considerations in mind,
          we list the topologies on <m>\reals</m> that the subspace topologies on <m>L</m> are like based on line directions and orientations for product topologies
          <m>\realsl \times \reals</m> and <m>\realsl \times \realsl</m>:

          Show that the dictionary order topology on the set
          <m>\reals \times \reals</m> is the same as the product topology on <m>\reals_d \times \reals</m>,
          where <m>\reals_d</m> denotes <m>\reals</m> in the discrete topology.
          Compare this topology with the standard topology on <m>\reals^2</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          In what follows let <m>\cT_d</m> denote the dictionary order topology on <m>\reals \times \reals</m>,
          and let <m>\cT_p</m> denote the product topology on <m>\reals_d \times \reals</m>.
          Also let <m>\prec</m> denote the dictionary ordering of <m>\reals \times \reals</m>.
          First we show that <m>\cT_d = \cT_p</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we note that clearly the dictionary order on
            <m>\reals \times \reals</m> has no largest or smallest elements so that,
            by definition,
            <m>\cT_d</m> has as basis elements intervals <m>((x,y), (x',y'))</m>,
            that is the set of all points
            <m>z \in \reals \times \reals</m> where <m>(x,y) \prec z \prec (x',y')</m>.
            Clearly the set <m>\braces{\braces{x} \where x \in \reals}</m> is a basis for <m>\reals_d</m>.
            Hence, by Theorem<nbsp/>15.1, the set
            <m>\cB_p = \braces{\braces{x} \times (a,b) \where \text{ \(x \in \reals\) and \(a \lt b\) } }</m> is a basis for the product topology <m>\cT_p</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>(x,y) \in \reals \times \reals</m> and any basis element
            <m>B_d = ((a,b), (a',b'))</m> of <m>\cT_d</m> that contains <m>(x,y)</m>.
            Hence <m>(a,b) \prec (x,y) \prec (a',b')</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a = x</m>: Then since <m>(a,b) \prec (x,y)</m>,
            it has to be that <m>b \lt y</m>. \begin{indpar} Case:
            <m>a = x = a'</m>.
            Then it also has to be that
            <m>y \lt b'</m> since <m>(x,y) \prec (a',b')</m>.
            Then the set <m>B_p = \braces{x} \times (b,b')</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> that contains <m>(x,y)</m> and is a subset of <m>B_d</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a = x \lt a'</m>.
            Then it is easy to show that the set
            <m>B_p = \braces{x} \times (b, y+1)</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> that contains <m>(x,y)</m> and is a subset of <m>B_d</m>. \end{indpar}
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a \lt x</m>: \begin{indpar} Case: <m>x = a'</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>y \lt b'</m> since <m>(x,y) \prec (a',b')</m>.
            Then it is easy to show that the set
            <m>B_p = \braces{x} \times (y-1, b')</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> that contains <m>(x,y)</m> and is a subset of <m>B_d</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a = x \lt a'</m>.
            Then it is easy to show that the set
            <m>B_p = \braces{x} \times (y-1, y+1)</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> that contains <m>(x,y)</m> and is a subset of <m>B_d</m>. \end{indpar} In every case and sub-case it follows from Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 that <m>\cT_d \ss \cT_p</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose <m>(x,y) \in \reals \times \reals</m> and
            <m>B_p = \braces{x} \times (a,b)</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> containing <m>(x,y)</m>.
            Also let <m>B_d</m> be the interval in the dictionary order <m>((x,a), (x,b))</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of <m>\cT_d</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that
            <m>B_p = B_d</m> so that <m>x \in B_d \ss B_p</m>,
            which shows that <m>\cT_p \ss \cT_d</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            This suffices to show that <m>\cT_d = \cT_p</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          We now claim that this topology
          <m>\cT_d = \cT_p</m> is strictly finer than the standard topology on <m>\reals \times \reals</m>.
          We denote the latter by simply <m>\cT</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Since it was just shown that <m>\cT_d = \cT_p</m>,
            it suffices to show that either one is strictly finer than the standard topology.
            It shall be most convenient to use the product topology <m>\cT_p</m>.
            So first consider any <m>(x,y) \in \reals^2</m> and any basis element
            <m>B = (a,b) \times (c,d)</m> of <m>\cT</m> containing <m>(x,y)</m>.
            Hence <m>a \lt x \lt b</m> and <m>c \lt y \lt d</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that the set <m>\braces{x} \times (c,d)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m>,
            contains <m>(x,y)</m> and is a subset of <m>B</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cT_p</m> is finer than <m>\cT</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is strictly finer,
            consider the point <m>(0,0)</m> and the set <m>B_p = \braces{0} \times (-1,1)</m>,
            which clearly contains <m>(0,0)</m> and is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m>.
            Now consider any basis element
            <m>B = (a,b) \times (c,d)</m> of <m>\cT</m> that also contains <m>(0,0)</m>.
            It then follows that <m>a \lt 0 \lt b</m> and <m>c \lt 0 \lt d</m>.
            Consider then the point <m>x = (a+0)/2 = a/2</m> so that clearly
            <m>a \lt x \lt 0 \lt b</m> and hence <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
            Thus the point <m>(x,0) \in B</m>,
            but also <m>(x,0) \notin B_p</m> since <m>x \lt 0</m> so that <m>x \neq 0</m>.
            This shows that <m>B</m> cannot be a subset of <m>B_p</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary basis element of <m>\cT</m>,
            this shows that <m>\cT</m> is <em>not</em>
            finer than <m>\cT_p</m> by the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            This suffices to show that <m>\cT_p</m> is strictly finer than <m>\cT</m> as desired.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>I = [0,1]</m>.
          Compare the product topology on <m>I \times I</m>,
          the dictionary order topology on <m>I \times I</m>,
          and the topology <m>I \times I</m> inherits as a subspace of
          <m>\reals \times \reals</m> in the dictionary order topology.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we assume that the product topology on
          <m>I \times I</m> is the product of <m>I</m> with the order topology as this seems to be the standard when no topology is explicitly specified.
          Denote this product topology by <m>\cT_p</m>.
          Let <m>\cT_d</m> denote the dictionary order topology on <m>I \times I</m>,
          and let <m>\cT_s</m> denote the subspace topology on
          <m>I \times I</m> inherited as a subspace of
          <m>\reals \times \reals</m> in the dictionary order topology.
          Lastly, let <m>\prec</m> denote the dictionary order on
          <m>I \times I</m> and <m>\reals \times \reals</m>.
          To avoid ambiguity we also use the notation
          <m>x \times y</m> to denote the ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> and reserve parentheses for open intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we claim that <m>\cT_p</m> and <m>\cT_d</m> are incomparable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, consider the point <m>0 \times 1 \in I \times I</m> and <m>B_p = \clop{0,1/2} \times \opcl{1/2,1}</m>,
            which is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> that clearly contains <m>0 \times 1</m>.
            Note that <m>B_p</m> is a basis element because <m>\clop{0,1/2}</m> and
            <m>\opcl{1/2,1}</m> are both basis elements in the order topology on <m>I</m> since <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> are the smallest and largest elements of <m>I</m>,
            respectively.
            Now consider any interval <m>B_d = (a \times b, a' \times b')</m> in the dictionary order on
            <m>I \times I</m> that contains <m>0 \times 1</m>,
            which is of course a basis element of <m>\cT_d</m>.
            Then we have that <m>a \times b</m> and <m>a' \times b'</m> are in
            <m>I \times I</m> with <m>a \times b \prec 0 \times 1 \prec a' \times b'</m>.
            Hence <m>0 \lt a'</m> or <m>0 = a'</m> and <m>1 \lt b'</m>.
            As <m>1</m> is the largest element of <m>I</m>,
            the latter case is not possible so that it must be that <m>0 \lt a'</m>.
            Let <m>x = (0+a')/2 = a'/2</m> so that clearly <m>0 \lt x \lt a'</m>.
            Then we have that <m>a \times b' \prec x \times 0 \prec a' \times b'</m> so that the point <m>x \times 0</m> is in <m>B_d</m>.
            However, clearly <m>0 \notin \opcl{1/2,1}</m> so that <m>x \times 0 \notin B_p</m>.
            This shows that <m>B_d</m> cannot be a subset of <m>B_p</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we note that, in the dictionary order on <m>I \times I</m>,
            the smallest element is <m>0 \times 0</m> while the largest is <m>1 \times 1</m>.
            With this in mind,
            the above argument for an open interval also applies to the half-open intervals
            <m>\clop{0 \times 0, a \times b}</m> and <m>\opcl{a \times b,1 \times 1}</m>,
            which are of course also basis elements of <m>\cT_d</m>.
            This then shows that <m>\cT_d</m> is not finer than <m>\cT_p</m> by the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider the point <m>0 \times 1/2</m> and the interval
            <m>B_d = (0 \times 0,0 \times 1)</m> in the dictionary ordering,
            which is therefore a basis element of <m>\cT_d</m>,
            and clearly also contains <m>0 \times 1/2</m>.
            Consider also any basis element
            <m>B_p = A \times B</m> of <m>\cT_p</m> that contains <m>0 \times 1/2</m>.
            Since <m>0 \in A</m> and <m>A</m> must be a basis element of the order topology on <m>I</m>,
            it has to be that <m>A = \clop{0, a}</m> for some <m>0 \lt a \leq 1</m>.
            Then let <m>x = (0+a)/2 = a/2</m> so that
            <m>0 \lt x \lt a</m>, and thus <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then, since <m>1/2 \in B</m>
            (since <m>0 \times 1/2 \in A \times B</m>),
            we have that <m>x \times 1/2 \in A \times B = B_p</m> as well.
            However, we also clearly have that
            <m>0 \times 1 \prec x \times 1/2</m> since <m>0 \lt x</m> so that <m>x \times 1/2 \notin (0 \times 0,0 \times 1) = B_d</m>.
            This shows that <m>B_p</m> cannot be a subset of <m>B_d</m>.
            As <m>B_p</m> was an arbitrary basis element of <m>\cT_p</m>,
            this shows by the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 that <m>\cT_p</m> is not finer than <m>\cT_d</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This suffices to show that <m>\cT_d</m> and <m>\cT_p</m> are incomparable.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we claim that <m>\cT_s</m> is strictly finer than <m>\cT_p</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \times y \in I \times I</m> and suppose that
            <m>B_p = A \times B</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_p</m> that contains <m>x \times y</m>.
            First suppose that <m>A = (a,b)</m> and
            <m>B = (c,d)</m> so that of course <m>a,b,c,d \in I</m>,
            <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>, and <m>c \lt y \lt d</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that the interval
            <m>B_s = (x \times c,x \times d)</m> in the dictionary order also contains <m>x \times y</m>,
            is a basis element of <m>\cT_s</m> (since
            <m>B_s \ss I \times I</m> so that <m>B_s \cap (I \times I) = B_s</m>),
            and is a subset of <m>B_p</m>.
            A similar argument can be made if <m>A</m> is an interval of the form
            <m>\clop{0,a}</m> or <m>\opcl{a,1}</m>.
            If <m>B = \opcl{c,1}</m> and <m>A</m> is still <m>(a,b)</m>,
            then let <m>X</m> be the interval
            <m>(x \times c, x \times 2)</m> in the dictionary order so that we have
            <m>B_s = X \cap (I \times I) = \braces{x} \times \opcl{c,1}</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_s</m> that contains
            <m>x \times y</m> and is a subset of <m>B_p</m>.
            A similar argument applies if
            <m>B = \clop{0,d}</m> and/or when the interval <m>A</m> is half-open.
            This shows that <m>\cT_s</m> is finer than <m>\cT_p</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            The argument above that shows that <m>\cT_p</m> is not finer than <m>\cT_d</m> using the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 applies equally well to show that <m>\cT_p</m> is not finer than <m>\cT_s</m>.
            This of course suffices to show the desired result that <m>\cT_s</m> is strictly finer than <m>\cT_p</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly, we claim that <m>\cT_s</m> is also strictly finer than <m>\cT_d</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any point <m>x \times y</m> in
            <m>I \times I</m> and let <m>B_d</m> be a basis element of <m>\cT_d</m> that contains
            <m>x \times y</m> so that it is some kind of interval with endpoints <m>a \times b</m> and
            <m>a' \times b'</m> in <m>I \times I</m>.
            We note here that,
            since <m>\reals \times \reals</m> has no smallest or largest elements,
            basis elements of the dictionary order topology there can only be open intervals.
            Now, if <m>B_d</m> is an open interval in
            <m>I \times I</m> then clearly then the same interval
            <m>B = (a \times b,a' \times b')</m> is a basis element in the dictionary order topology of <m>\reals \times \reals</m>,
            though though the two intervals can in general be different sets.
            For example the interval <m>(0 \times 0, 1 \times 1)</m> in <m>\reals \times \reals</m> contains the point
            <m>0 \times 100</m> whereas the same interval in
            <m>I \times I</m> does not since <m>0 \times 100 \notin I \times I</m>.
            It is, however, trivial to show that
            <m>B \cap (I \times I) = B_d</m> so that <m>B_d</m> is basis element of <m>\cT_s</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we have that <m>B_d</m> is the half-open interval
            <m>\clop{0 \times 0, a' \times b'}</m> then let <m>B = (0 \times -1, a' \times b')</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of the dictionary order topology on <m>\reals \times \reals</m>.
            It is then easy to see that
            <m>B \cap (I \times I) = B_d</m> again so that it is a basis element of <m>\cT_s</m>.
            If <m>B_d</m> is the half-open interval <m>\opcl{a \times b, 1 \times 1}</m>,
            then the open interval <m>(a \times b, 1 \times 2)</m> is a basis element of the dictionary order topology on
            <m>\reals \times \reals</m> and has the same result.
            Hence in all cases <m>B_d</m> is also a basis element of <m>\cT_s</m>,
            and that it trivially is a subset of itself,
            and it contains <m>x \times y</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cT_s</m> is finer than <m>\cT_d</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is strictly finer,
            consider the point <m>0 \times 1</m> and the open interval <m>B = (0 \times 0, 0 \times 2)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of the dictionary order topology in <m>\reals \times \reals</m>.
            It is then easy to prove that
            <m>B_s = B \cap (I \times I) = \braces{0} \times \opcl{0,1} = \opcl{0 \times 0, 0 \times 1}</m> so that <m>B_s</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_s</m>.
            Now consider any basis element <m>B_d</m> of <m>\cT_d</m> that contains
            <m>0 \times 1</m> so that <m>B_d</m> is some type of dictionary-order interval with endpoints
            <m>a \times b</m> and <m>a' \times b'</m>,
            both in <m>I \times I</m>.
            The only way the interval can be closed above is if <m>a' \times b' = 1 \times 1</m>,
            in which case clearly <m>1 \times 1 \in B_d</m> but <m>1 \times 1 \notin B_s</m>.
            So assume that it is open above so that <m>0 \times 1 \prec a' \times b'</m>,
            and hence either <m>0 \lt a'</m> or <m>0 = a'</m> and <m>1 \lt b'</m>.
            The latter case cannot be since <m>1</m> is the largest element of <m>I</m> and <m>b' \in I</m>.
            Therefore it has to be that <m>0 \lt a'</m>.
            So let <m>x = (0+a')/2 = a'/2</m> so that
            <m>0 \lt x \lt a'</m> and thus <m>0 \times 1 \prec x \times 0 \prec a' \times b'</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>x \times 0</m> is in <m>B_d</m>.
            However, clearly <m>x \times 0 \notin B_s</m> since <m>0 \times 1 \prec x \times 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in any case we have shown that,
            while they both contain <m>0 \times 1</m>,
            <m>B_d</m> cannot be a subset of <m>B_s</m>.
            Since <m>B_d</m> was an arbitrary basis element,
            this shows that <m>\cT_d</m> is not finer than <m>\cT_s</m> by the negation of Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            This shows the desired result that <m>\cT_s</m> is strictly finer than <m>\cT_d</m>.

          Show that the collection

            <mrow>\cT = \braces{X - C \where C \in \cC}</mrow>

          is a topology on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly <m>\es</m> and <m>X</m> are in <m>\cT</m> since <m>\es = X - X</m> and
            <m>X = X - \es</m> and both <m>X</m> and <m>\es</m> are in <m>\cC</m>.
            This shows the first defining property of a topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider an arbitrary sub-collection <m>\cA</m> of <m>\cT</m>.
            Then, for each <m>A \in \cA</m>,
            we have that <m>A = X - B</m> for some
            <m>B \in \cC</m> since also <m>A \in \cT</m>.
            So let <m>\cB = \braces{B \in \cC \where X - B \in \cA}</m>.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bigcup \cA = \bigcup_{A \in \cA} A = \bigcup_{B \in \cB} (X - B) = X - \bigcap_{B \in \cB} B = X - \bigcap \cB</mrow>
            </md>
            by DeMorgan's law.
            By the definition of <m>\cC</m> we have that
            <m>\bigcap \cB \in \cC</m> since it is an arbitrary intersection of elements of <m>\cC</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\bigcup \cA = X - \bigcap \cB</m> is in <m>\cT</m> by definition.
            This shows the second defining property of a topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, suppose that <m>\cA</m> is a nonempty finite sub-collection of <m>\cT</m>,
            which of course can be expressed as
            <m>\cA = \braces{A_k \where k \in \intsfin{n}}</m> for some positive integer <m>n</m>.
            Then, again we have that that
            <m>A_k = X - B_k</m> for some <m>B_k \in \cC</m> for all
            <m>k \in \intsfin{n}</m> since <m>A_k \in \cT</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\bigcap \cA = \bigcap_{k=1}^n A_k = \bigcap_{k=1}^n (X - B_k) = X - \bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k</mrow>
            </md>
            by DeMorgan's law.
            Then clearly <m>\bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k</m> is in <m>\cC</m> by definition since it is a finite union of elements of <m>\cC</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\bigcap \cA = X - \bigcup_{k=1}^n B_k</m> is in <m>\cT</m> by definition.
            Since <m>\cA</m> was an arbitrary finite sub-collection,
            this shows the third defining property of a topology.
            Hence <m>\cT</m> is a topology by definition.

            Since <m>A</m> is closed in <m>Y</m>,

            Hence by definition <m>X - B</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
            Also, since <m>Y</m> is closed in <m>X</m>,
            we have that <m>X - Y</m> is open in <m>X</m> by definition.

            </md>

            Since both <m>X - B</m> and <m>X - Y</m> are open in <m>X</m>,
            clearly their union must also be open since we are in a topological space.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First, since <m>A</m> is closed in <m>X</m>,
            we have that <m>B = X - A</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
            and it follows from <xref ref="cor_closedlim_cc">Corollary</xref> that <m>A = X - B</m>.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>U - A = U - (X - B) = (U - X) \cup (U \cap B)</mrow>
            </md>
            by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_setmid">Lemma</xref>.
            Since <m>U \ss X</m>, it follows that <m>U - X = \es</m>,
            and hence
            <md>
              <mrow>U - A = \es \cup (U \cap B) = U \cap B \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, since both <m>U</m> and <m>B</m> are open,
            their intersection is as well and therefore <m>U - A</m> is open.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we have by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_setmid">Lemma</xref>
            <md>
              <mrow>X - (A - U) = (X - A) \cup (X \cap U) = B \cup (X \cap U) = B \cup U</mrow>
            </md>.
            since <m>U \ss X</m> so that <m>X \cap U = U</m>.
            Since both <m>B</m> and <m>U</m> are open,
            clearly their union is as well and hence <m>X - (A - U)</m> is open.
            This of course means that <m>A - U</m> is closed by definition.

          Let <m>X</m> be an ordered set in the order topology.
          Show that <m>\closure{(a,b)} \ss [a,b]</m>.
          Under what conditions does equality hold?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> is closed
            (hence why it is called such!)
            because clearly its compliment is
            <md>
              <mrow>X - [a,b] = (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty)</mrow>
            </md>
            and we know that open rays are always open so that their union is as well.
            Clearly also <m>[a,b]</m> contains <m>(a,b)</m>.
            Hence <m>[a,b]</m> is a closed set containing <m>(a,b)</m>.
            Since <m>\closure{(a,b)}</m> is defined as the intersection of closed sets that contain <m>(a,b)</m> clearly we have that <m>\closure{(a,b)} \ss [a,b]</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          The conditions required for equality are such that <m>[a,b]</m> is also a subset of <m>\closure{(a,b)}</m> and,
          in particular both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> must be in <m>\closure{(a,b)}</m>.
          Since clearly <m>a,b \notin (a,b)</m>,
          it has to be that they are both limit points of <m>(a,b)</m>.
          This is equivalent to the condition that <m>a</m> has no immediate successor and <m>b</m> no immediate predecessor.
          We show only the first of these since the second is analogous.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> We show the contrapositive of this.
            So suppose that <m>a</m> <em>does</em>
            have an immediate successor <m>c</m>.
            Then the open ray <m>(-\infty,
            c)</m> is an open set that contains <m>a</m> but does not intersect <m>(a,b)</m>.
            This is easy to see, because if they did intersect,
            there would be an <m>x \in (a,b)</m> where also <m>x \in (-\infty, c)</m>.
            From these it follows that <m>a \lt x \lt c</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>c</m> is the immediate successor of <m>a</m>.
            Hence by definition <m>a</m> is not a limit point of <m>(a,b)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Suppose that <m>a</m> is not a limit point of <m>(a,b)</m>.
            Then there is an open set <m>U</m> containing <m>a</m> that does not intersect <m>(a,b)</m>.
            From this it follows that there is a basis element <m>B</m> containing <m>a</m> such that <m>B \ss U</m>,
            and thus <m>B</m> also cannot intersect <m>(a,b)</m>
            (as, if it did, then so would <m>U</m>).
            Suppose that <m>B</m> is the open interval <m>(c,d)</m> so that <m>c \lt a \lt d</m>.
            It also must be that <m>d \lt b</m> for otherwise,
            for any element of <m>x</m> of <m>(a,b)</m>,
            we would have <m>c \lt a \lt x \lt b \leq d</m> so that
            <m>x \in (c,d) = B</m> and <m>B</m> and <m>(a,b)</m> would not be disjoint.
            We claim that <m>d</m> is the immediate successor of <m>a</m>.
            If this is not the case then there would be an <m>x</m> such that
            <m>c \lt a \lt x \lt d</m> and hence <m>x \in (c,d) = B</m>.
            Also <m>a \lt x \lt d \lt b</m> so that also <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
            Therefore <m>B</m> and <m>(a,b)</m> would not be disjoint.
            Similar arguments can be made if <m>B</m> are other types of basis element in the order topology. (Actually <m>B</m> cannot be of the form
            <m>\opcl{e,f}</m> for largest element <m>f</m> of <m>X</m> since then any element of <m>(a,b)</m> would also be in <m>B</m> and they would not be disjoint.)
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          It is also worth noting that the Hausdorff axiom
          (and therefore also the <m>T_1</m> axiom since it is implied by the Hausdorff axiom)
          is not sufficient for general equivalence of <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>\closure{(a,b)}</m>.
          For example the order topology on <m>\ints</m> results in the discrete topology so that every subset is both open and closed.
          Thus for any pair <m>x_1, x_2</m> in <m>\ints</m>,
          the sets <m>\braces{x_1}</m> and
          <m>\braces{x_2}</m> are neighborhoods of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>,
          respectively, that are disjoint.
          This shows that this topology is a Hausdorff space.
          However, the fact that <m>a</m> has an immediate successor in <m>\pints</m> is sufficient to show that
          <m>[a,b] \neq \closure{(a,b)}</m> per what was just shown above.

            Suppose that <m>A \ss B</m> and consider any <m>x \in \clA</m>.
            Consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> so that <m>U</m> intersects <m>A</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Hence there is a point <m>y \in U \cap A</m> so that <m>y \in U</m> and <m>y \in A</m>.
            But then clearly <m>y \in B</m> also since <m>A \ss B</m>.
            Therefore <m>y \in U \cap B</m> so that <m>U</m> intersects <m>B</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>x</m>,
            this shows that <m>x \in \clB</m>,
            again by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            This of course shows that <m>\clA \ss \clB</m> as desired since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> We show this by contrapositive.
            So suppose that <m>x \notin \clA \cup \clB</m>.
            Then clearly <m>x \notin \clA</m> and <m>x \notin \clB</m>.
            Thus, by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a),
            there is an open set <m>U_A</m> such that <m>U_A</m> does not intersect <m>A</m>,
            and likewise an open <m>U_B</m> that does not intersect <m>B</m>.
            Let <m>U = U_A \cap U_B</m>,
            which is clearly open since <m>U_A</m> and <m>U_B</m> are.
            We also note that <m>U</m> contains <m>x</m> since both <m>U_A</m> and <m>U_B</m> do.
            Then it must be that <m>U</m> does not intersect <m>A</m> since,
            if it did,
            then <m>U_A</m> would also intersect <m>A</m> since <m>U \ss U_A</m>.
            Similarly, <m>U</m> cannot intersect <m>B</m>.
            Thus, for all <m>y \in U</m>,
            <m>y \notin A</m> and <m>y \notin B</m>.
            This is logically equivalent to saying that there is no <m>y \in U</m> where <m>y \in A</m> or <m>y \in B</m>,
            therefore there is no <m>y \in U</m> where <m>y \in A \cup B</m>.
            Hence <m>U</m> and <m>A \cup B</m> do not intersect.
            Since <m>U</m> is open and contains <m>x</m>,
            this shows that <m>x \notin \closure{A \cup B}</m>,
            again by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Therefore, by contrapositive,
            <m>x \in \closure{A \cup B}</m> implies that
            <m>x \in \clA \cup \clB</m> so that <m>\closure{A \cup B} \ss \clA \cup \clB</m>.

            <m>(\sps)</m> Consider any
            <m>x \in \clA \cup \clB</m> and any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m>.
            If <m>x \in \clA</m> then <m>U</m> intersects <m>A</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Hence there is a <m>y \in U \cap A</m> so that <m>y \in U</m> and <m>y \in A</m>.
            Then clearly <m>y \in A \cup B</m> so that <m>y</m> is also in <m>U \cap (A \cup B)</m>.
            Hence <m>U</m> intersects <m>A \cup B</m>.
            An analogous argument shows that this is also true if <m>x \in \clB</m> instead.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood,
            this shows that <m>x \in \closure{A \cup B}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Hence <m>\clA \cup \clB \ss \closure{A \cup B}</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.

            Then clearly <m>U</m> also intersects

            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary open set containing <m>x</m>,
            this shows that <m>x \in \closure{\bigcup A_\a}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            This shows that <m>\bigcup \clA_\a \ss \closure{\bigcup A_\a}</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,

          As an example where equality fails,

          <m>A_n = \opcl{1/n, 2}</m> for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
          It is then trivial to show that
          <m>\bigcup A_n = \opcl{0, 2}</m> so that clearly <m>0</m> is a limit point of <m>\bigcup A_n</m>,
          and hence <m>0 \in \closure{\bigcup A_n}</m>.
          However, for any <m>n \in \pints</m>,
          the open interval <m>(-1, 1/n)</m> is clearly an open set containing <m>0</m> that is disjoint from <m>\opcl{1/n, 2} = A_n</m>.
          This shows that <m>0 \notin \clA_n</m> for every
          <m>n \in \pints</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a),
          from which it follows that <m>0 \notin \bigcup \clA_n</m>.
          Hence <m>\closure{\bigcup A_n}</m> is not a subset of

            from which it immediately follows that <m>U</m> intersects both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
            However, since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>x</m>,
            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a) again that <m>x</m> is in both <m>\clA</m> and <m>\clB</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in \clA \cap \clB</m>,
            which shows that <m>\closure{A \cap B} \ss \clA \cap \clB</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider the standard topology on <m>\reals</m> with
            <m>A = \clop{-1,0}</m> and <m>B = \opcl{0,1}</m>.
            As these are clearly disjoint,
            we have that <m>A \cap B = \es</m> so that <m>\closure{A \cap B} = \es</m> also.
            However, since we also clearly have that
            <m>\clA = [-1,0]</m> and <m>\clB = [0,1]</m>,
            it follows that <m>\clA \cap \clB = \braces{0}</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>\closure{A \cap B} = \es \neq \braces{0} = \clA - \clB</m> as desired.

        <p>
          (b) We again claim that <m>\closure{\bigcap A_\a} \ss \bigcap \clA_\a</m> but that equality is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in \closure{\bigcap A_\a}</m> and any open set <m>U</m> of <m>x</m>.
            Then, by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a),
            <m>U</m> intersects <m>\bigcap A_\a</m> so that,
            for any particular <m>A_\b</m>,
            <m>U</m> intersects <m>A_\b</m>.
            This shows that <m>x \in \clA_\b</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a) so that
            <m>x \in \clA_\a</m> for every <m>\a</m> since <m>\b</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence <m>x \in \bigcap \clA_\a</m>,
            which shows that <m>\closure{\bigcap A_\a} \ss \bigcap \clA_\a</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            As in part<nbsp/>(a),
            equality fails if we have <m>A_1 = \clop{-1,0}</m> and
            <m>A_2 = \opcl{0,1}</m> in the standard topology on <m>\reals</m>.
            By the same argument as in part<nbsp/>(a) it follows that <m>\closure{\bigcap_{n=1}^2 A_n} = \es \neq \braces{0} = \bigcap_{n=1}^2 \clA_n</m>.

          (c) Here we claim that <m>\closure{A-B} \sps \clA - \clB</m> but that the converse does not always hold.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in \clA - \clB</m> and any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>.
            Then <m>x \in \clA</m> so that every open set containing <m>x</m> intersects <m>A</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Also <m>x \notin \clB</m> so that there is an open set <m>V</m> containing <m>x</m> that does not intersect <m>B</m>,
            also by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Let <m>W = U \cap V</m> so that <m>W</m> contains <m>x</m> since both <m>x \in U</m> and <m>x \in V</m>.
            Now, since <m>W</m> is also an open set containing <m>x</m>,
            <m>W</m> intersects <m>A</m> so that there is a <m>y \in W</m> where also <m>y \in A</m>.
            It also cannot be that <m>y \in B</m> since we have
            <m>y \in W \ss V</m> so that then <m>V</m> would intersect <m>B</m>.
            Therefore <m>y \in A - B</m>.
            Also we have <m>y \in W \ss U</m> so that also <m>y \in U</m>.
            Hence <m>U</m> intersects <m>A - B</m>,
            which shows that <m>x \in \closure{A-B}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a) since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
            Therefore <m>\closure{A-B} \sps \clA - \clB</m> as desired since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a counterexample to equality,
            consider the standard topology on <m>\reals</m> with
            <m>A = [0,2]</m> and <m>B = \opcl{1,3}</m>.
            Then clearly <m>\clA = A = [0,2]</m> and <m>\clB = [1,3]</m>,
            from which it is easily shown that <m>\clA - \clB = \clop{0,1}</m>.
            But we also have <m>A - B = [0,1]</m> so that obviously <m>\closure{A-B} = [0,1]</m> as well.
            Therefore <m>\closure{A-B} = [0,1] \neq \clop{0,1} = \clA - \clB</m> as desired.

          Show that every order topology is Hausdorff.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>X</m> is an ordered set with the order topology.
            Consider a pair of distinct points <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in <m>X</m>.
            Since <m>X</m> is an order,
            <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> must be comparable since they are distinct,
            so we can assume that <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m> without loss of generality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_2</m> is the immediate successor of <m>x_1</m>.
            Then, if <m>X</m> has a smallest element <m>a</m> then clearly the set <m>U_1 = \clop{a, x_2}</m> is a neighborhood
            (because it is a basis element)
            of <m>x_1</m>.
            If <m>X</m> has no smallest element then there is an <m>a \lt x_1</m> so that
            <m>U_1 = (a, x_2)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x_1</m>.
            Similarly <m>U_2 = \opcl{x_1, b}</m> or
            <m>U_2 = (x_1, b)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x_2</m>,
            where <m>b</m> is either the largest element of <m>X</m> or <m>x_2 \lt b</m>,
            respectively.
            Either way, for any <m>y \in U_1</m> we have that <m>y \lt x_2</m> so that
            <m>y \leq x_1</m> since <m>x_2</m> is the immediate successor of <m>x_1</m>.
            Hence it is not true that <m>y > x_1</m> so that <m>y \notin U_2</m>.
            This shows that <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> are disjoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_2</m> is not the immediate successor of <m>x_1</m>.
            Then there is an <m>x \in X</m> where <m>x_1 \lt x \lt x_2</m>.
            So let <m>U_1 = \clop{a,x}</m> (or
            <m>U_1 = (a, x)</m>) for the smallest element <m>a</m> of <m>X</m>
            (or some <m>a \lt x_1</m>).
            Similarly let <m>U_2 = \opcl{x,b}</m> (or
            <m>U_2 = (x,b)</m>) for the largest element <m>b</m> of <m>X</m>
            (or some <m>x_2 \lt b</m>).
            Either way <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> are neighborhoods of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>,
            respectively.
            If <m>y \in U_1</m> then <m>y \lt x</m> so that clearly it is not true that <m>y > x</m> so that <m>x \notin U_2</m>.
            Hence again <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> are disjoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in either case we have shown that <m>X</m> is a Hausdorff space as desired since <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> were an arbitrary pair.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are Hausdorff spaces and consider two distinct points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and
            <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> in <m>X \times Y</m>.
            Since these points are distinct,
            it has to be that <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m> or <m>y_1 \neq y_2</m>.
            In the first case <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are distinct points of <m>X</m> so that there are disjoint neighborhoods <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>,
            respectively.
            This of course follows from the fact that <m>X</m> is a Hausdorff space.
            Then we have that <m>U_1 \times Y</m> and
            <m>U_2 \times Y</m> are both basis elements, and therefore open sets,
            in the product space <m>X \times Y</m> since <m>Y</m> itself is obviously an open set of <m>Y</m>.
            Clearly also <m>(x_1,y_1) \in U_1 \times Y</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2) \in U_2 \times Y</m> so that
            <m>U_1 \times Y</m> is a neighborhood of <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and
            <m>U_2 \times Y</m> is a neighborhood of <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, for any <m>(x,y) \in U_1 \times Y</m> we have that <m>x \in U_1</m> so that
            <m>x \notin U_2</m> since they are disjoint.
            Then it has to be that <m>(x,y) \notin U_2 \times Y</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>U_1 \times Y</m> and
            <m>U_2 \times Y</m> are disjoint since <m>(x,y)</m> was arbitrary.
            Thus <m>X \times Y</m> is a Hausdorff space since the points
            <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> were arbitrary.
            An analogous argument in the case in which

            Suppose that <m>X</m> is a Hausdorff space and that <m>Y</m> is a subset of <m>X</m>.
            Consider any two distinct points <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> in <m>Y</m> so that of course also <m>y_1,y_2 \in X</m>.
            Then there are neighborhoods <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> of <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m>,
            respectively, that are disjoint since <m>X</m> is Hausdorff.
            Since <m>U_1</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
            we have that <m>V_1 = U_1 \cap Y</m> is open in <m>Y</m> by the definition of a subspace topology.
            Clearly also <m>V_1</m> contains <m>y_1</m> since
            <m>y_1 \in U_1</m> and <m>y_1 \in Y</m>.
            Similarly <m>V_2 = U_2 \cap Y</m> is an open set of <m>Y</m> that contains <m>y_2</m>.
            Then, for any <m>x \in V_1</m> clearly <m>x \in U_1</m> so that
            <m>x \notin U_2</m> since <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> are disjoint.
            Then <m>x \notin U_2 \cap Y = V_2</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>V_1</m> and <m>V_2</m> are disjoint,
            which then shows that <m>Y</m> is a Hausdorff space as desired.

            Then it must be that <m>x \neq y</m> so that there are disjoint neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>y</m> since <m>X</m> is Hausdorff.
            Then <m>U \times V</m> is a basis element of <m>X \times X</m>,
            by the definition of a product topology, and is therefore open.
            Now consider any point <m>w \times z \in U \times V</m> so that <m>w \in U</m> and <m>z \in V</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>w \neq z</m> since <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are disjoint,

            Since <m>w \times z</m> was an arbitrary point of <m>U \times V</m>,

            Since also <m>U \times V</m> is open and contains <m>x \times y</m>,

            Moreover, since <m>x \times y</m> was an arbitrary element of

            <m>x \times y</m> cannot be a limit point of <m>\D</m>
            (since it contains all its limit points by Corollary<nbsp/>17.7).
            Hence there is an open set <m>T</m> in <m>X \times X</m> that contains
            <m>x \times y</m> and does not intersect <m>\D</m>.
            It then follows that there is a basis element
            <m>U \times V</m> of <m>X \times X</m> containing
            <m>x \times y</m> where <m>U \times V \ss T</m>.
            Then <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are both open in <m>X</m> by the definition of the product topology,
            and clearly <m>x \in U</m> and <m>y \in V</m>.
            It also follows that <m>U \times V</m> does not intersect <m>\D</m> since,
            if it did,
            then <m>T</m> would as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are not disjoint so that there is a <m>z \in U</m> where also <m>z \in V</m>.
            Then clearly <m>z \times z \in U \times V</m> but we also have that <m>z \times z \in \D</m> so that
            <m>U \times V</m> intersects <m>\D</m>.
            As we know that this cannot be the case,
            it has to be that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are disjoint.
            This shows that <m>X</m> is Hausdorff as desired since <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>,
            <m>V</m> is a neighborhood of <m>y</m>,
            and <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary distinct points of <m>X</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          In the finite compliment topology on <m>\reals</m>,
          to what point or points does the sequence <m>x_n = 1/n</m> converge?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We claim that this sequence converges to every point in <m>\reals</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that this is not the case so that there is point
            <m>a \in \reals</m> where the sequence does not converge to <m>A</m>.
            Then there is an open set <m>U</m> containing <m>a</m> such that,
            for every <m>N \in \pints</m>,
            there is an <m>n \geq N</m> where <m>x_n \notin U</m>.
            It is easy to see that <m>x_n \notin U</m> for an infinite number of <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            For, if this were not the case,
            then there would be an <m>N \in \pints</m> where
            <m>x_n \in U</m> for every <m>n \geq N</m>.
            We know, though, that there must be an
            <m>n \geq N</m> where <m>x_n \notin U</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, clearly every <m>x_n</m> in the sequence is distinct so that there are an infinite number of points not in <m>U</m>.
            Since each of these points are still in <m>X</m>,
            we have that <m>X - U</m> is infinite.
            As this is the finite compliment topology and <m>U</m> is open,
            this can only be the case if <m>X - U = X</m> itself,
            in which case it would have be that <m>U = \es</m> since <m>U \ss X</m>.
            This is not possible since <m>U</m> contains <m>a</m>.
            So it seems that a contradiction has been reached,
            which shows the desired result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          In fact, this is true for any sequence for which the image of the sequence <m>\braces{x_n \where n \in \pints}</m> is infinite.
          This is to say that any such sequence converges to every point of <m>\reals</m>.
          Note also that this shows that the finite compliment topology on <m>\reals</m> is not a Hausdorff space by the contrapositive of Theorem<nbsp/>17.10.

          Show the <m>T_1</m> axiom is equivalent to the condition that for each pair of points of <m>X</m>,
          each has a neighborhood not containing the other.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that, though it does not say so above,
          the points must be distinct since any neighborhood containing <m>x</m> obviously has to contain <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that a space <m>X</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom and consider any two distinct points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> of <m>X</m>.
            Then the point <m>\braces{x}</m> is closed since it is finite,
            and hence it also contains all of its limit points by Corollary<nbsp/>17.7.
            Since the point <m>y</m> is not in <m>\braces{x}</m>
            (since <m>y \neq x</m>),
            it cannot be a limit point of <m>\braces{x}</m>.
            Hence there is a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>y</m> that does not intersect <m>\braces{x}</m>.
            Hence <m>x \notin U</m>.
            An analogous argument involving
            <m>\braces{y}</m> shows that there is a neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>x</m> that does not contain <m>y</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary points,
            this shows the desired property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that,
            for each pair of distinct points in <m>X</m>,
            each point has a neighborhood that does not contain the other point.
            As in the proof of Theorem<nbsp/>17.8, it suffices to show that every one-point set is closed,
            since any finite set can be expressed as the finite union of such sets,
            which is also then closed by Theorem<nbsp/>17.1.
            So let <m>\braces{x}</m> be such a one-point set and consider any
            <m>y \notin \braces{x}</m> so that clearly <m>y \neq x</m>.
            Then, since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are distinct,
            there is a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>U</m> does not contain <m>x</m>.
            Therefore <m>U</m> and <m>\braces{x}</m> are disjoint.
            This shows that <m>y</m> is not a limit point of <m>\braces{x}</m>,
            which shows that <m>\braces{x}</m> contains all its limit points since <m>y \notin \braces{x}</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence <m>\braces{x}</m> is closed as desired by Corollary<nbsp/>17.7.

              Suppose that <m>\cT</m> and <m>\cT'</m> are topologies on <m>X</m> and <m>\cT'</m> is finer than <m>\cT</m>.
              If <m>\cT</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom, then so does <m>\cT'</m>.
              Similarly, if <m>\cT</m> is Hausdorff, then so is <m>\cT'</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, suppose that <m>\cT</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom and consider any finite subset <m>A</m> of <m>X</m>.
            Then <m>A</m> is closed in <m>\cT</m> by the <m>T_1</m> axiom so that by definition <m>X - A</m> is open in <m>\cT</m> and hence <m>X -A \in \cT</m>.
            Then <m>X - A \in \cT'</m> as well since
            <m>\cT \ss \cT'</m> so that <m>X - A</m> is open in <m>\cT'</m>.
            Hence <m>A</m> is closed in <m>\cT'</m> by definition.
            Since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary finite set,
            this shows that <m>\cT'</m> also satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>\cT</m> is Hausdorff,
            and consider any two distinct points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>X</m>.
            Then there are neighborhoods <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>y</m>,
            both in <m>\cT</m>,
            that do not intersect since <m>\cT</m> is Hausdorff.
            Then clearly <m>U,V \in \cT'</m> as well since <m>\cT \ss \cT'</m>.
            Hence <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are neighborhoods of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
            respectively, in <m>\cT'</m> that do not intersect.
            This shows that <m>\cT'</m> is Hausdorff as desired since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary points of <m>X</m>.

          Next we justify these claims for each part.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) First we show that <m>\clK = K \cup \braces{0}</m> in <m>\cT_1</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> Consider any real number <m>x</m> and suppose that <m>x \notin K \cup \braces{0}</m>,
            hence <m>x \notin K</m> and <m>x \neq 0</m>.
            Since <m>x \neq 0</m>, we have
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \lt 0</m>.
            Then clearly the open set <m>(x-1,0)</m> contains <m>x</m> but does not intersect <m>K</m> since <m>0 \lt y</m> for every <m>y \in K</m>,
            but <m>y \lt 0</m> for every <m>y \in (x-1,0)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x > 0</m>.
            If <m>1 \lt x</m>,
            then <m>(1, x+1)</m> contains <m>x</m> but does not intersect <m>K</m> since
            <m>y \leq 1</m> for every <m>y \in K</m>,
            but <m>1 \lt y</m> for every <m>y \in (1, x+1)</m>.
            If <m>1 \geq x</m> it follows from the fact that
            <m>x \notin K</m> that there is a positive integer <m>n</m> where <m>n \lt 1/x \lt n+1</m>,
            and hence <m>1/(n+1) \lt x \lt 1/n</m>.
            Then clearly the open set <m>(1/(n+1), 1/n)</m> contains <m>x</m>,
            but we also have that it does not intersect <m>K</m>.
            If it did, then there would be an integer <m>m</m> where
            <m>1/(n+1) \lt 1/m \lt 1/n</m> so that <m>n \lt m \lt n+1</m>,
            which we know is not possible since <m>n+1</m> is the immediate successor of <m>n</m> in <m>\pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in all cases there is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> that does not intersect <m>K</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>x \notin \clK</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            We have therefore shown that
            <m>x \notin K \cup \braces{0}</m> implies that <m>x \notin \clK</m>.
            By contrapositive, this shows that <m>\clK \ss K \cup \braces{0}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>0</m> so that there is a basis element <m>(a,b)</m> containing <m>0</m> that is a subset of <m>U</m>.
            Then <m>a \lt 0 \lt b</m>.
            Clearly there is an <m>n \in \pints</m> large enough where
            <m>a \lt 0 \lt 1/n \lt b</m> and hence <m>1/n \in (a,b) \ss U</m>.
            Since also <m>1/n \in K</m>, we have that <m>U</m> intersects <m>K</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood,
            this shows that <m>0</m> is in <m>\clK</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Since also clearly any <m>x \in K</m> is also in <m>\clK</m>,
            it follows that <m>\clK \sps K \cup \braces{0}</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show that <m>\clK = K</m> in <m>\cT_2</m>,
          which is to say that <m>K</m> is already closed.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly <m>K \ss \clK</m> basically by definition.
            Now consider any <m>x \notin K</m>.
            Then clearly the set <m>B = (x-1,x+1) - K</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_2</m>.
            Also it clearly contains <m>x</m> since
            <m>x \notin K</m> and also does not intersect <m>K</m> since <m>y \in B</m> means that <m>y \notin K</m>.
            This shows that <m>x</m> is not in <m>\clK</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(b).
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary this shows that
            <m>x \notin K</m> implies that <m>x \notin \clK</m>.
            Thus <m>\clK \ss K</m> by contrapositive.
            This suffices to show that <m>\clK = K</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we show that <m>\clK = \reals</m> in <m>\cT_3</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any real <m>x</m> and any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m>.
            Then <m>U</m> is open in <m>\cT_3</m> so that <m>\reals - U</m> must be finite,
            noting that <m>\reals - U</m> cannot be all of <m>\reals</m> since <m>U</m> would then have to be empty since <m>U \ss \reals</m>,
            whereas we know that <m>x \in U</m>.
            It then follows that there are a finite number of real numbers not in <m>U</m>.
            However, clearly <m>K</m> is an infinite set so that there must be an element of <m>K</m> that
            <em>is</em> in <m>U</m>.
            This shows that <m>K</m> intersects <m>U</m> so that <m>x</m> is in <m>\clK</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a) since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood.
            Hence <m>\reals \ss \clK</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            Clearly also <m>\clK \ss \reals</m> so that <m>\clK = \reals</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show that <m>\clK = K</m> in <m>\cT_4</m> so that <m>K</m> is closed.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Clearly <m>K \ss \clK</m>.
            So consider any real <m>x</m> where <m>x \notin K</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \leq 0</m>.
            Then the set <m>B = \opcl{x-1,x}</m> is clearly a basis element of <m>\cT_4</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
            For any <m>y \in K</m> we have that
            <m>x \leq 0 \lt y</m> so that <m>y \notin B</m>.
            Hence <m>B</m> does not intersect <m>K</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x > 0</m>.
            If <m>1 \leq x</m> then it has to be that <m>1 \lt x</m> since
            <m>1 = 1/1 \in K</m> but <m>x \notin K</m>,
            and hence <m>x \neq 1</m>.
            Then <m>B = \opcl{1,x}</m> is clearly a basis element of <m>\cT_4</m> and contains <m>x</m>.
            This also clearly does not intersect <m>K</m> since
            <m>y \leq 1</m> for any <m>y \in K</m> so that <m>y \notin B</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>1 > x</m> then there is an integer <m>n</m> where <m>n \lt 1/x \lt n+1</m> so that
            <m>1/(n+1) \lt x \lt 1/n</m> since <m>x \notin K</m>.
            It then follows that the set
            <m>B = \opcl{1/(n+1),
            x}</m> is a basis element of <m>\cT_4</m> that contains <m>x</m> and does not intersect <m>K</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in all cases there is a basis element <m>B</m> containing <m>x</m> that does not intersect <m>K</m>.
            This shows that <m>x \notin \clK</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(b).
            Hence we have shown that <m>x \notin K</m> implies that <m>x \notin \clK</m>,
            which shows by contrapositive that <m>\clK \ss K</m>.
            Therefore <m>\clK = K</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly we show that <m>\clK = \braces{x \in \reals \where 0 \leq x}</m> in <m>\cT_5</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, let <m>A = \braces{x \in \reals \where 0 \leq x}</m> and consider any <m>x \in A</m> and any basis element <m>B = (-\infty,a)</m> containing <m>x</m>.
            Hence clearly <m>0 \leq x</m> since <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \lt a</m> since <m>x \in B</m>.
            Thus <m>0 \leq x \lt a</m> so that there is an integer <m>n</m> large enough that <m>0 \lt 1/n \lt a</m>.
            Then <m>1/n \in B</m> and also clearly <m>1/n \in K</m>.
            Thus <m>B</m> intersects <m>K</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was any neighborhood of <m>x</m> it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(b) that <m>x \in \clK</m>.
            Hence <m>A \ss \clK</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>x \notin A</m> so that <m>x \lt 0</m>.
            Then the set <m>B = (-\infty,0)</m> is clearly a basis element of <m>\cT_5</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
            Since <m>0 \lt y</m> for any <m>y \in K</m>,
            it follows that <m>y \notin B</m>,
            and thus <m>B</m> cannot intersect <m>K</m>.
            Hence by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(b) we have that <m>x \notin \clK</m>.
            This shows that <m>\clK \ss A</m> by contrapositive,
            which completes the proof that <m>\clK = A</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) First we show that <m>\cT_1</m>, <m>\cT_2</m>,
          and <m>\cT_4</m> are Hausdorff spaces and satisfy the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any two distinct points <m>x,y \in \reals</m>.
            Without loss of generality, we can assume that <m>x \lt y</m>.
            Let <m>z = (x+y)/2</m> so that clearly <m>x \lt z \lt y</m>.
            Then obviously the open intervals <m>(x-1,z)</m> and <m>(z,y+1)</m> are disjoint open sets in <m>\cT_1</m> that contain <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
            respectively.
            This shows that <m>\cT_1</m> is a Hausdorff space and therefore also satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom by Theorem<nbsp/>17.8.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows that <m>\cT_2</m> and <m>\cT_4</m> are also both Hausdorff and satisfy the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
            This follows from <xref ref="lem_closedlim_axiomsf">Lemma</xref>
            since it was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>13.7 that <m>\cT_1 \ss \cT_2 \ss \cT_4</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show that <m>\cT_3</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom but is not a Hausdorff space.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            So first consider any finite subset <m>A</m> of <m>\reals</m>.
            Let <m>U = X - A</m> so that clearly <m>A = X - (X - A) = X - U</m>.
            Then, since <m>X - U = A</m> is finite,
            it follows that <m>U</m> is open in <m>\cT_3</m> by the definition of the finite complement topology.
            Hence by definition <m>A</m> is closed in <m>\cT_3</m> since <m>X - A = U</m> is open.
            This shows that <m>\cT_3</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary finite subset of <m>\reals</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>\cT_3</m> is not Hausdorff,
            consider any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>0</m> and any open set <m>V</m> containing <m>1</m>.
            It then has to be that <m>\reals - U</m> is finite since it cannot be that
            <m>\reals - U = \reals</m> itself since then <m>U</m> would have to be empty
            (which we know is not the case since <m>0 \in U</m>)
            since <m>U \ss \reals</m>.
            Likewise <m>\reals - V</m> is also finite.
            Thus there are a finite number of real numbers that are not in <m>U</m> and a finite number that are not in <m>V</m>.
            From this it clearly follows that there are a finite number of real numbers <m>x</m> where
            <m>x \notin U</m> or <m>x \notin V</m>.
            Since we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x \notin U \lor x \notin V \bic \lnot (x \in U \land x \in V) \bic \lnot (x \in U \cap V) \bic x \notin U \cap V \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            it has to be that there are a finite number of reals numbers that are not in <m>U \cap V</m>.
            But since <m>\reals</m> is infinite,
            this means that there are an infinite number of real numbers that
            <em>are</em> in <m>U \cap V</m>.
            Hence <m>U \cap V \neq \es</m>, i.e. they intersect.
            Since <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> were arbitrary neighborhoods,
            this shows that <m>\cT_3</m> is not Hausdorff by the negation of the definition.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly we prove that <m>\cT_5</m> is neither a Hausdorff space nor satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider the distinct real numbers <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.
            Consider then any open set <m>V</m> containing <m>1</m> so that there is a basis element
            <m>B = (-\infty,
            a)</m> that contains <m>1</m> and is a subset of <m>U</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>0 \in B</m> since
            <m>0 \lt 1 \lt a</m> and hence <m>0 \in U</m> since <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>1</m>,
            it follows there is no neighborhood of <m>1</m> that does not contain <m>0</m>.
            Hence <m>\cT_5</m> does not satisfy the <m>T_1</m> axiom by the negation of Exercise<nbsp/>17.15.
            It also then follows that <m>\cT_5</m> is not a Hausdorff space by the contrapositive of Theorem<nbsp/>17.8.

            Let <m>e = \min(b,d)</m> so that <m>a \lt e</m> since both <m>a \lt d</m> and <m>a \lt b</m>.
            Then of course there is a real <m>y</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>e</m> so that <m>a \lt y \lt e</m>.

            Consider any real <m>x</m>,

            Obviously there is a rational <m>p</m> where <m>p \lt x</m> since the rationals are unbounded below.
            Similarly, there is a rational <m>q</m> where
            <m>x \lt q \lt a</m> since the rationals are order-dense in the reals.
            The set <m>B = \clop{p,q}</m> is then clearly a basis element of <m>\cT_c</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
            It is also trivial to show that <m>B</m> does not intersect <m>A</m> since <m>q \lt a</m>,

          First, it follows directly from <xref ref="lem_closedlim_openi">Lemma</xref>
          that that <m>\clA = \clop{0, \sqrt{2}}</m> and <m>\clB = \clop{\sqrt{2},3}</m> in <m>\cT_l</m>.
          It is worth noting that <m>\clA</m> and <m>\clB</m> are both basis elements of <m>\cT_l</m>,
          which is interesting since they are closures and therefore closed.
          This of course implies that basis elements in <m>\cT_l</m> are both open and closed,
          which is indeed the case and is easy to see after a little thought.

            Clearly then <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m>.
            If <m>y = b</m> then the dictionary order interval

            Lastly, if <m>y > b</m> then the dictionary order interval

            Case: <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y = 1</m>.
            If <m>y = 0</m> then we have \begin{indpar} Case: <m>x = 0</m>.
            Then, if <m>b = y = 0</m>,
            we have that the dictionary order interval
            <m>\clop{0 \times 0, 0 \times 1}</m> is a basis element containing
            <m>x \times y = 0 \times 0</m> but no other points of <m>B</m>,
            if indeed <m>x = 0 \in A</m> so that <m>x \times y \in B</m>.
            If <m>b \neq 0</m> then <m>0 \lt b</m> so that the interval
            <m>\clop{0 \times 0, 0 \times b}</m> is a basis element with the same properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \neq 0</m>.
            Then <m>0 \lt x</m> and it has to be that <m>x</m> is a not a limit point of <m>A</m> from below.
            Thus there is an interval <m>(c,d)</m> or <m>\opcl{c,1}</m>
            (or <m>\clop{0,d}</m> in which case let <m>c=0</m> in what follows)

            If <m>b = y = 0</m> then it is easy to show that <m>(c \times 1, x \times 1)</m>

          <p>
            Thus in all cases and sub-cases it follows that
            <m>x \times y</m> is not a limit point of <m>B</m>,

          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that either <m>y = 1</m> and <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>A</m> from above or <m>y = 0</m> and <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>A</m> from below.
            In the first case consider any dictionary order interval
            <m>C = (a \times c, d \times e)</m> that contains <m>x \times y</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>x \lt d</m> since otherwise it would have to be that
            <m>y = 1 \lt e</m> since <m>x \times y \prec d \times e</m>,
            which is of course impossible.
            Then, since <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>A</m> from above,
            it follows that the open set
            <m>\clop{0,d}</m> contains a point <m>z \in A</m> where <m>x \lt z</m> so that <m>x \lt z \lt d</m>.
            It then follows that the point
            <m>z \times b</m> is in both <m>C</m> and <m>B</m>,
            and is of course distinct from
            <m>x \times y</m> since <m>x \lt z</m>.
            The same argument can be made if <m>C</m> is a basis element in the form of
            <m>\clop{0 \times 0, d \times e}</m> or <m>\opcl{a \times c, 1 \times 1}</m>.
            This suffices to show that
            <m>x \times y</m> is a limit point of <m>B</m> since <m>C</m> was an arbitrary basis element.

          First we claim that <m>\clA = A \cup \braces{0 \times 1}</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, let <m>K = \braces{1/n \where n \in \pints} \ss [0,1]</m> so that clearly <m>A = \braces{x \times 0 \where x \in K}</m>.
            It is easy to show that <m>0</m> is the only limit point of <m>K</m> and it is a limit point from above only.
            It then follows from <xref ref="lem_closedlim_unitsq">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>0 \times 1</m> is the only limit point of <m>A</m> so that
            <m>\clA = A \cup \braces{0 \times 1}</m> since the closure is the union of the set and the set of its limit points.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we claim that <m>\clB = B \cup \braces{1 \times 0}</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            This time let <m>L = \braces{1-1/n \where n \in \pints}</m> so that clearly <m>B = \braces{x \times \tfrac{1}{2} \where x \in L}</m>.
            It is trivial to show that <m>1</m> is the only limit point of <m>L</m> and that it is a limit point from below only.
            Hence <m>1 \times 0</m> is the only limit point of <m>B</m> by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_unitsq">Lemma</xref> so that the result follows.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we claim that <m>\closure{C} = C \cup \braces{1 \times 0} \cup \braces{x \times 1 \where 0 \leq x \lt 1}</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, we clearly have that <m>C = \braces{x \times 0 \where x \in (0,1)}</m>.
            It is easy to show that every point of <m>(0, 1)</m> is a limit point both from above and below,
            that <m>0</m> is a limit point from above only,
            and that <m>1</m> is a limit point from below only.
            Thus it follows that the set of limit points of <m>C</m> are then
            <m>\braces{x \times 0 \where 0 \lt x \leq 1} \cup \braces{x \times 1 \where 0 \leq x \lt 1}</m> by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_unitsq">Lemma</xref>.
            As many of these points are contained in <m>C</m> itself,
            the result follows.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>\closure{D} = D \cup \braces{x \times 0 \where 0 \lt x \leq 1} \cup \braces{x \times 1 \where 0 \leq x \lt 1}</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            The limit points of <m>D</m> are the same as for <m>C</m> above for the same reasons, i.e.
            <m>\braces{x \times 0 \where 0 \lt x \leq 1} \cup \braces{x \times 1 \where 0 \leq x \lt 1}</m>.
            The result then follows.

          Lastly, we claim that <m>\closure{E} = \braces{\tfrac{1}{2} \times y \where 0 \leq y \leq 1} = \braces{\tfrac{1}{2}} \times [0,1]</m>,
          noting that clearly <m>E = \braces{\tfrac{1}{2}} \times (0,1)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>F = \braces{\tfrac{1}{2}} \times [0,1]</m> so that we must show that <m>\closure{E} = F</m>.

            <m>(\ss)</m> Consider any <m>x \times y</m> where <m>x \times y \notin F</m> so that simply
            <m>x \neq \tfrac{1}{2}</m> since it has to be that <m>y \in [0,1]</m>.
            If <m>x \lt \tfrac{1}{2}</m> then the basis element <m>\clop{0 \times 0, \tfrac{1}{2} \times 0}</m> clearly contains
            <m>x \times y</m> but no elements of <m>E</m>.
            If <m>x > \tfrac{1}{2}</m> then the basis element <m>\opcl{\tfrac{1}{2} \times 1, 1 \times 1}</m> clearly contains
            <m>x \times y</m> but no elements of <m>E</m> either.
            This shows that <m>x \times y</m> is a not in
            <m>\closure{E}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(b).

            <m>x \times y \in \closure{E}</m> since obviously <m>E \ss \closure{E}</m>.
            If <m>y = 0</m> then consider any dictionary order interval
            <m>F = (a \times c, b \times d)</m> containing <m>x \times y = \tfrac{1}{2} \times 0</m>.
            In particular we have that
            <m>\tfrac{1}{2} \times 0 \prec b \times d</m> so that either <m>\tfrac{1}{2} \lt b</m>,
            or <m>b = \tfrac{1}{2}</m> and <m>0 \lt d</m>.
            In the first case we have that
            <m>\tfrac{1}{2} \times \tfrac{1}{2}</m> is in both <m>F</m> and <m>E</m>.
            In the second case let <m>z = d/2</m> so that we have <m>0 \lt z \lt d \leq 1</m>.
            Then clearly the point <m>\tfrac{1}{2} \times z</m> is in <m>F</m>,
            but we also have that <m>\tfrac{1}{2} \times z</m> is in <m>E</m> since <m>0 \lt z \lt 1</m>.
            The same argument applies if the basis element <m>F</m> is of the form
            <m>\clop{0 \times 0, b \times d}</m> or <m>\opcl{a \times c, 1 \times 1}</m>.
            A similar argument shows an analogous result in the case when <m>y = 1</m>.
            This shows by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(b) that
            <m>x \times y \in \closure{E}</m> since <m>F</m> was an arbitrary basis element,
            which of course shows that

            we have that <m>y \in A</m> and hence <m>y \notin X - A</m>.
            This shows that <m>U</m> does not intersect <m>X - A</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>x</m> is not in the closure of <m>X - A</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Thus <m>x</m> is not in the boundary of <m>A</m> since <m>\Bd{A} = \clA \cap \closure{(X-A)}</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>\Int{A}</m> and <m>\Bd{A}</m> are disjoint since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>\clA = \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A}</m>,
            first consider any <m>x \in \clA</m>.
            If <m>x \in \Int{A}</m> then clearly <m>x \in \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A}</m>,
            so assume that <m>x \notin \Int{A}</m>.
            Consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>X</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>U</m> is not a subset of <m>A</m> since otherwise <m>x</m> would be in the union of open subsets of <m>A</m> and hence in the interior.
            It then follows that there is a point <m>y \in U</m> where
            <m>y \notin A</m> and therefore <m>y \in X - A</m>.
            This shows that <m>U</m> intersects <m>X - A</m> so that <m>x</m> is in the closure of <m>X - A</m> since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood.
            Since also <m>x \in \clA</m>,
            we have that <m>x \in \clA \cap \closure{(X-A)} = \Bd{A}</m>.
            Hence clearly <m>x \in \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A}</m> so that
            <m>\clA \ss \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A}</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x \in \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A}</m>.
            If <m>x \in \Int{A}</m> then also
            <m>x \in \clA</m> since we have that <m>\Int{A} \ss A \ss \clA</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>x \in \Bd{A} = \clA \cap \closure{(X-A)}</m> then of course <m>x \in \clA</m>.
            This shows that <m>\Int{A} \cup \Bd{A} \ss \clA</m> in either case since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            Since both directions have been shown,
            it follows that <m>\clA = \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A}</m> as desired.

            <m>(\imp)</m> First suppose that <m>\Bd{A} = \es</m>.
            Then by part<nbsp/>(a) we have that <m>\clA = \Int{A} \cup \Bd{A} = \Int{A} \cup \es = \Int{A}</m>.
            Hence <m>A \ss \clA = \Int{A}</m> so that
            <m>A = \Int{A}</m> since it is also always the case that <m>\Int{A} \ss A</m>.
            This shows that <m>A</m> is open since <m>\Int{A}</m> is always open.
            We also have <m>\clA = \Int{A} \ss A</m> so that
            <m>A = \clA</m> since it is always also the case that <m>A \ss \clA</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>A</m> is also closed since <m>\clA</m> is always closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that <m>A</m> is both open and closed.
            It then follows that <m>\clA = A = \Int{A}</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in \clA</m> so that also <m>x \in \Int{A}</m>.
            Then there is a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> contained entirely in <m>A</m>.
            Thus, for any point <m>y \in U</m>,
            we have that <m>y \in A</m> so that <m>y \notin X - A</m>,
            which shows that <m>U</m> does not intersect <m>X - A</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>,
            this shows that <m>x \notin \closure{X-A}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Then, since <m>x</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>\clA</m>,
            it follows that <m>\clA</m> and
            <m>\closure{X-A}</m> are disjoint so that <m>\Bd{A} = \clA \cap \closure{(X-A)} = \es</m> as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> First suppose that <m>U</m> is open and consider any <m>x \in \Bd{U}</m>.
            Then we have that <m>x \in \clU</m> and
            <m>x \in \closure{X-U}</m> since <m>\Bd{U} = \clU \cap \closure{(X-U)}</m> by definition.
            Suppose for the moment that <m>x \in U</m> so that <m>U</m> itself is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> since it is open.
            For any <m>y \in U</m> we have that <m>y \notin X - U</m>,
            and hence <m>U</m> does not intersect <m>X - U</m>.
            This shows that <m>x</m> is not in
            <m>\closure{X-U}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a),
            which is a contradiction since we know it is.
            Thus it must be that <m>x \notin U</m> so that <m>x \in \clU - U</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>\Bd{U} \ss \clU - U</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x \in \clU - U</m> so that clearly <m>x \in \clU</m>.
            Since also <m>x \notin U</m>,
            it follows that <m>x \in X-U</m> so that of course <m>x \in \closure{X-U}</m> as well.
            Hence <m>x \in \clU \cap \closure{(X-U)} = \Bd{U}</m>,
            which shows that <m>\clU - U \ss \Bd{U}</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            This suffices to show that <m>\Bd{U} = \clU - U</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that
            <m>\Bd{U} = \clU - U</m> and consider any <m>x \in U</m>.
            Then we have that <m>x \notin \clU - U = \Bd{U} = \clU \cap \closure{(X-U)}</m>.
            Since we know that <m>x \in \clU</m>
            (since <m>U \ss \clU</m>),
            it must be that <m>x \notin \closure{X-U}</m>.
            Thus, by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a),
            there is a neighborhood of <m>V</m> of <m>x</m> that does not intersect <m>X - U</m>.
            This means that, for any point <m>y \in V</m>,
            we have that <m>y \notin X - U</m>.
            Since of course <m>y \in X</m>,
            it follows that <m>y</m> must be in <m>U</m>.
            This shows that <m>V \ss U</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence <m>V</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> that is entirely contained in <m>U</m> so that <m>x</m> is in the union of open sets contained in <m>U</m>,
            hence <m>x \in \Int{U}</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>U</m>,
            this shows that <m>U \ss \Int{U}</m>.
            As it is always the case that <m>\Int{U} \ss U</m> as well,
            we have that <m>U = \Int{U}</m> so that <m>U</m> is open since <m>\Int{U}</m> is always open.

        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample consider the set
            <m>U = \realsnz</m> in the finite complement topology on <m>\reals</m>.
            Clearly <m>U</m> is open as its complement <m>\reals - U = \braces{0}</m> is finite.
            It is also obvious that <m>U</m> is an infinite set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any real number <m>x</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>x</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>\reals - V</m> is all of <m>\reals</m> since then <m>V</m> would be empty,
            and we know that <m>x \in V</m>.
            So it must be that <m>\reals - V</m> is finite since <m>V</m> is open,
            which means that there are only a finite number of real numbers that are
            <em>not</em> in <m>V</m>.
            However, since <m>U</m> is infinite,
            there must be an element of <m>U</m> that <em>is</em> in <m>V</m>
            (in fact there are an infinite number of such elements).
            Hence <m>V</m> intersects <m>U</m> so that
            <m>x \in \clU</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Since <m>x \in \reals</m> was arbitrary,
            it must be that <m>\clU</m> is all of <m>\reals</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly <m>\reals</m> is open
            (since the a set is always open in any topology on that set)
            so that <m>\Int(\clU) = \Int{\reals} = \reals</m>.
            Then, since <m>0 \in \reals = \Int(\clU)</m> but <m>0 \notin U</m>,
            we have that <m>U \neq \Int(\clU)</m>.

          and that also <m>\closure{\reals - A} = A</m> so that <m>\Bd{A} = A</m>.
          It is also easy to see that no basis element and therefore no neighborhood of any point in <m>A</m> is contained entirely within <m>A</m>.
          From this it follows that <m>\Int{A} = \es</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) It is easy to show that <m>B</m> is open so that <m>\Int{B} = B</m>.
          It is likewise not difficult to prove that <m>\clB = \braces{x \times y \where x \geq 0}</m>.
          We then have from Exercise<nbsp/>17.19 part<nbsp/>(c) that <m>\Bd{B} = \clB - B = \braces{x \times y \where x = 0} \cup \braces{x \times y \where x > 0 \text{ and } y = 0}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Here we have that <m>C = A \cup B = \braces{x \times y \where y = 0} \cup \braces{x \times y \where x > 0}</m>.
          It is then easy to show that the closure is <m>\closure{C} = \braces{x \times y \where y = 0} \cup \braces{x \times y \where x \geq 0}</m>.
          We also have that <m>\reals - C = \braces{x \times y \where x \leq 0 \text{ and }  y \neq 0}</m> so that <m>\closure{\reals - C} = \braces{x \times y \where x \leq 0}</m>.
          From these we clearly then have

            <mrow>\Bd{C} = \closure{C} \cap \closure{(\reals - C)} = \braces{x \times y \where x \lt  0 \text{ and }  y = 0} \cup \braces{x \times y \where x = 0} \,</mrow>

          (d) Clearly we have that <m>\closure{D}</m> is all of
          <m>\reals^2</m> as a consequence of the fact that the rationals are order-dense in the reals.
          Also, since any neighborhood of any point in <m>D</m> will intersect a point
          <m>x \times y</m> with irrational <m>x</m>,
          it follows that no point of <m>D</m> is in its interior.
          Thus <m>\Int{D} = \es</m> so that
          <m>\closure{D} = \Int{D} \cup \Bd{D} = \es \cup \Bd{D} = \Bd{D}</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>17.19 part<nbsp/>(a),

          (e) It should be fairly obvious by this point that

          </md>
          and <m>\Int{E} = \braces{x \times y \where 0 \lt  x^2 - y^2 \lt  1}</m>.
          This would be easy but tedious to prove rigorously.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) First we clearly have that <m>\Int{F} = \braces{x \times y \where x \neq 0 \text{ and } y \lt 1/x}</m>.
          We also have that <m>\closure{F} = \braces{x \times y \where x = 0} \cup \braces{x \times y \where x \neq 0 \text{ and } y \leq 1/x}</m>.
          By Exercise<nbsp/>17.19 part<nbsp/>(a) we have that <m>\closure{F} = \Int{F} \cup \Bd{F}</m> and that
          <m>\Int{F} \cap \Bd{F} = \es</m> so that <m>\Bd{F} = \closure{F} - \Int{F}</m>.
          Thus we have that <m>\Bd{F} = \braces{x \times y \where x = 0} \cup \braces{x \times y \where x \neq 0 \text{ and } y = 1/x}</m>.

            Then by Lemma<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a) there is an open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m> where <m>U</m> does not intersect <m>A</m>.
            For any <m>y \in U</m> we thus have that
            <m>y \notin A</m> and hence <m>y \in X - A = xA</m>.
            This shows that <m>U \ss xA</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            which suffices to show that
            <m>x \in \Int(xA) = ixA</m> since <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>x \in cA \cup ixA</m> so that
            <m>X \ss cA \cup ixA</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            This completes the proof that <m>X = cA \cup ixA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>cA</m> and <m>ixA</m> are disjoint,
            consider any <m>x \in cA</m>.
            Consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> so that <m>U</m> intersects <m>A</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>17.5 part<nbsp/>(a).
            Hence there is a point <m>y \in U</m> where also <m>y \in A</m>,
            from which it follows that <m>y \notin X - A = xA</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>U</m> is not a subset of <m>xA</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> is an arbitrary neighborhood,
            this shows that <m>x \notin \Int(xA) = ixA</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>cA</m> and <m>ixA</m> are disjoint as desired.

          <p>
            (a) This was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>17.6 part<nbsp/>(a).
          </p>
          <p>
            (b) Consider any <m>x \in iA</m> so that there is a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> that is totally contained in <m>A</m>.
            Then clearly <m>U</m> is also totally contained in <m>B</m> as well since,
            for any <m>x \in U</m>,
            we have that <m>x \in A</m> and hence <m>x \in B</m> since <m>A \ss B</m>.
            This shows that <m>x \in iB</m> since <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
            Hence <m>iA \ss iB</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            (c) Since <m>cA = \clA</m> is closed,
            we clearly have <m>ccA = cA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (d) Since <m>iA = \Int{A}</m> is open,
            its interior is itself, i.e.
            <m>iiA = iA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (e) Obviously <m>xxA = X - (X - A) = A</m> since <m>A \ss X</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (f) We have by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_part">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>X = cA \cup ixA</m> where <m>cA</m>,
            and <m>ixA</m> are mutually disjoint.

          </p>
          <p>
            (h) First we have that <m>icA = iicA</m> by (d).
            Also clearly <m>icA = c(icA) = cicA</m> since a set is always a subset of its closure.
            Hence by (b) we have that <m>icA = iicA = i(icA) \ss i(cicA) = icicA</m>.
            Now, we also have that <m>icA = i(cA) \ss cA</m> since the interior of a set is always a subset of the set.
            Hence by (a) and (c) we have <m>cicA = c(icA) \ss c(cA) = ccA = cA</m>.
            It then follows from (b) that <m>icicA = i(cicA) \ss i(cA) = icA</m> as well.
            This of course shows that <m>icicA = icA</m> as desired.

          <em>Main Problem.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We are interested in sequences applying the operators <m>c</m> and <m>x</m> to a subset <m>A</m>.
            By <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>
            (c) and (e) we have that <m>ccA = cA</m> and <m>xxA = A</m>.
            Thus there is no point in ever applying <m>c</m> or <m>x</m> twice in a row since that would clearly result in a set that we have seen before.
            We are then interested only in sequences that apply alternating <m>c</m> and <m>x</m>.
            If we apply the closure <m>c</m> first,
            we obtain the following sequence:
            <md>
              <mrow>A \amp = A</mrow>
              <mrow>cA \amp = cA</mrow>
              <mrow>xcA \amp = ixA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
              <mrow>cxcA \amp = cixA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>xcxcA \amp = xcixA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = ixixA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icxxA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>g) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>e) }</mrow>
              <mrow>cxcxcA \amp = cicA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>xcxcxcA \amp = xcicA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = ixicA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icxcA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>g) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icixA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            If we apply the next operation we obtain
            <md>
              <mrow>cxcxcxcA \amp = cicixA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = cixA \,, \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>i) }</mrow>
            </md>
            which is the same as the fourth set above.
            Therefore we can get at most 7 distinct sets by applying <m>c</m> first,
            including <m>A</m> itself.
            If we instead apply <m>x</m> first then we get the following sequence:
            <md>
              <mrow>xA \amp = xA</mrow>
              <mrow>cxA \amp = cxA</mrow>
              <mrow>xcxA \amp = ixxA \amp  \text{ (corresponding result above) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = iA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>e) }</mrow>
              <mrow>cxcxA \amp = ciA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>xcxcxA \amp = xciA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = ixiA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icxA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>g) }</mrow>
              <mrow>cxcxcxA \amp = cicxA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>xcxcxcxA \amp = xcicxA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = ixicxA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icxcxA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>g) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = icixxA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>f) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = iciA \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>e) }</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Again if we try to apply the next operation we get
            <md>
              <mrow>cxcxcxcxA \amp = ciciA \amp  \pres</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = ciA\, \amp  \text{ (by <xref ref="lem_closedlim_idents">Lemma</xref>i) }</mrow>
            </md>
            which as before is the same as the fourth set in the sequence.
            Hence we have at most 7 distinct sets in this sequence for a total of 14 potentially distinct sets as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Note that this only shows that there can be
          <em>no more than</em> 14 distinct sets.
          It could be that there are always less than 14 in general.
          While there are certainly sets that generate less than 14 distinct sets,
          the next part shows the existence of a topology and a set that does result in 14 distinct sets.
          This of course shows that 14 is the lowest possible bound in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) We claim that <m>A = (-3, -2) \cup (-2, -1) \cup ([0,1] \cap \rats) \cup \braces{2}</m> in the standard topology on <m>\reals</m> is a set that results in 14 distinct sets when the operational sequences from part<nbsp/>(a) are applied.
          We do not prove each sequential operation as this is easy but would be prohibitively tedious.
          First we enumerate the first sequence, starting with <m>A</m>.

          such as <m>[0,1] \cap \rats</m> used as part of <m>A</m>,
          clearly every point in the interval is a limit point, including any irrational
          (or rational)
          points.
          This is because any open interval containing any real always contains both rationals and irrationals on account of <m>\rats</m> being order-dense in <m>\reals</m>.
          For the same reason no point of such an interval of rationals
          (or irrationals)
          is in its interior.
          If, for example <m>C = [0,1] \cap \rats</m>,
          this clearly then results in <m>cC = [0,1]</m> and <m>iC = \es</m>.
          Indeed this property of this part of <m>A</m> is crucial in its success in generating 14 distinct sets.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that for functions <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m>,
          the <m>\e</m>-<m>\d</m> definition of continuity implies the open set definition.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Recall that that <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m> is continuous at a point <m>x \in \reals</m> if,
          for every real <m>\e > 0</m>,
          there is a real <m>\d > 0</m> such that
          <m>\abs{f(y) - f(x)} \lt \e</m> for every real <m>y</m> where <m>\abs{y - x} \lt \d</m>.
          We say that <m>f</m> itself is continuous if it is continuous at every <m>p \in \reals</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m> is continuous by the <m>\e</m>-<m>\d</m> definition above.
            We show that this implies the open set definition by showing that <m>f</m> satisfies (4) in Theorem<nbsp/>18.1.
            So consider any <m>x \in \reals</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>f(x)</m>.
            Then of course there is a basis element <m>(c,d)</m> containing <m>f(x)</m> such that <m>(c,d) \ss V</m>.
            Let <m>\e = \min(f(x)-c, d-f(x))</m>,
            noting that <m>\e > 0</m> since <m>c \lt f(x) \lt d</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that
            <m>(f(x)-\e, f(x)+\e) \ss (c,d) \ss V</m> and contains <m>x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, since <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x</m>,
            there is <m>\d > 0</m> such that <m>\abs{y - x} \lt \d</m> implies that
            <m>\abs{f(y) - f(x)} \lt \e</m> for any real <m>y</m>.
            Let <m>U = (x-\d, x+\d)</m>, which is clearly a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
            Now consider any <m>z \in f(U)</m> so that
            <m>z = f(y)</m> for some <m>y \in U</m>.
            Then we have that <m>x - \d \lt y \lt x+ \d</m> so that clearly <m>-\d \lt y - x \lt \d</m>,
            from which it follows that <m>\abs{y-x} \lt \d</m>.
            We then know that <m>\abs{z - f(x)} = \abs{f(y) - f(x)} \lt \e</m> since <m>f</m> is continuous.
            Hence <m>-\e \lt z - f(x) \lt \e</m> so that <m>f(x) - \e \lt z \lt f(x) + \e</m>,
            and thus <m>z \in V</m> since <m>(f(x)-\e, f(x)+\e) \ss V</m>.
            Since <m>z \in f(U)</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f(U) \ss V</m>,
            which shows that (4) holds for <m>f</m> since <m>x</m> was also arbitrary.

          Suppose that <m>f: X \to Y</m> is continuous.
          If <m>x</m> is a limit point of the subset <m>A</m> of <m>X</m>,
          is it necessarily true the <m>f(x)</m> is a limit point of <m>f(A)</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is not necessarily true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample consider a constant function <m>f: X \to Y</m> defined by
            <m>f(x) = y_0</m> for any <m>x \in X</m> and some <m>y_0 \in Y</m>.
            It was shown in Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(a) that this is continuous.
            However, clearly <m>f(A) = \braces{y_0}</m> for any subset <m>A</m> of <m>X</m>.
            So even if <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>A</m>,
            no neighborhood of <m>f(x)</m> can intersect <m>f(A)</m> in a point other than
            <m>f(x) = y_0</m> since <m>y_0</m> is the only point in <m>f(A)</m>!
            Therefore <m>f(x)</m> is not a limit point of <m>f(A)</m>.

            First note that clearly the inverse of the identity function is itself with the domain and image reversed,
            and that for any subset <m>A \ss X = X'</m> we have <m>i(A) = \inv{i}(A) = A</m>.

            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that <m>i</m> is continuous and consider any open set <m>U \in \cT</m>.
            Then we have that <m>\inv{i}(U) = U</m> is open in <m>\cT'</m> since <m>i</m> is continuous.
            Since <m>U</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\cT \ss \cT'</m> so that <m>\cT'</m> is finer.

            <m>U</m> is also open in <m>\cT'</m>.
            Since <m>\inv{i}(U) = U</m>,

        <p>
          We only show that <m>f</m> is an imbedding of <m>X</m> in
          <m>X \times Y</m> as the argument for <m>g</m> is entirely analogous.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it is easy to see and trivial to formally show that <m>f</m> is injective.
            The function <m>f</m> can be of course be defined as <m>f(x) = f_1(x) \times f_2(x)</m> where
            <m>f_1 : X \to X</m> is the identity function and
            <m>f_2 : X \to Y</m> is the constant function that maps every element of <m>X</m> to <m>y_0</m>.
            Since these have both been proven to be continuous in the text,
            it follows that <m>f</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.4.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>f'</m> be the function obtained by restricting the range of <m>f</m> to <m>f(X) = \braces{x \times y_0 \where x \in X}</m>.
            Since <m>f</m> is injective, it follows that <m>f'</m> is a bijection.
            It follows from Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(e) that <m>f'</m> is continuous.
            Clearly the inverse function
            <m>\inv{f'}</m> is equal to the projection function <m>\pi_1</m> so that <m>\inv{f'}(x,y) = x</m>.
            This was shown to be continuous in the proof of Theorem<nbsp/>18.4.
            This suffices to show that <m>f'</m> is a homeomorphism,
            which shows the <m>f</m> is an imbedding of <m>X</m> in <m>X \times Y</m>.

        <p>
          First we show that <m>(a,b)</m> is homeomorphic to <m>(0,1)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First let <m>X = (a,b)</m> and <m>Y = (0,1)</m>,
            and define the map <m>f: X \to Y</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x) = \frac{x - a}{b - a}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>x \in X</m>, noting that this is defined since
            <m>a \lt  b</m> so that <m>b - a > 0</m>.
            It is trivial to show that <m>f</m> is a bijection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, <m>f</m> is a linear function that could just as well be defined as a map from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\reals</m>,
            and clearly this would be continuous by basic calculus.
            It then follows from Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(d) that restricting its domain to <m>X</m> means that it is still continuous.
            We also clearly have from basic algebra that its inverse is the function <m>\inv{f}: Y \to X</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>\inv{f}(y) = a + y(b-a)</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>y \in Y</m>.
            As this is also linear, it too is continuous by the same argument.
            This suffices to show that <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          The exact same argument shows that <m>[a,b]</m> is homeomorphic to <m>[0,1]</m> by simply setting
          <m>X = [a,b]</m> and <m>Y = [0,1]</m> in the above proof.
          It is assumed that here again <m>a \lt b</m> even though the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is valid if <m>a = b</m> and simply becomes <m>[a,b] = [a,a] = \braces{a}</m>.
          However, clearly this set cannot be homeomorphic to <m>[0,1]</m> since it is finite whereas <m>[0,1]</m> is uncountable.

            As it is easier to do so,
            we show this using the <m>\e</m>-<m>\d</m> definition of continuity,
            which we know implies the open set definition by Exercise<nbsp/>18.1.
            First we note that <m>f(0) = 0</m> since <m>0</m> is rational.
            Now consider any <m>\e > 0</m> and let <m>\d = \e</m>.
            Suppose real <m>y</m> where <m>\abs{y - 0} = \abs{y} \lt \d</m>.
            If <m>y</m> is rational then <m>y = 0</m> so that <m>\abs{f(y) - f(0)} = \abs{0 - 0} = \abs{0} = 0 \lt \e</m>.
            If <m>y</m> is irrational then <m>\abs{f(y) - f(0)} = \abs{y - 0} = \abs{y} \lt \d = \e</m> again.
            Since <m>\e</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x = 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x \neq 0</m>.
            Let <m>\e = \abs{x} / 2</m>,
            noting that <m>\e > 0</m> since
            <m>x \neq 0</m> so that <m>\abs{x} > 0</m>.
            Now consider any <m>\d > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \in \rats</m>.
            Then <m>f(x) = 0</m> but there is clearly an irrational <m>y</m> close enough to <m>x</m> so that <m>\abs{y - x} \lt  \min(\e, \d)</m>,
            and hence both <m>\abs{y-x} \lt  \e</m> and <m>\abs{y-x} \lt  \d</m>.
            We also have that <m>f(y) = y</m>.

          <statement>
            <p>
              In the topology <m>\realsl</m>,
              every basis element is both open and closed.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any basis element <m>B = \clop{a,b}</m>,
            which is clearly open since basis elements are always open.
            We then have that the complement of this set is <m>C = \reals - B = (-\infty,
            a) \cup \clop{b, \infty}</m>.
            We claim that this complement is also open so that <m>B</m> is closed by definition.
            To see this, define the sets
            <m>C_n = \clop{a-n-1, a-n+1} \cup \clop{b+n-1, b+n+1}</m> for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly each <m>C_n</m> is open since it is the union of two basis elements.
            It is also trivial to show that <m>C = \bigcup_{n \in \pints} C_n</m>,
            which is then also open since it is a union of open sets.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <lemma xml:id="lem_cont_Ropcl">
          <statement>
            <p>
              The only open sets in the standard topology on <m>\reals</m> that are both open and closed are <m>\es</m> and <m>\reals</m> itself.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly both <m>\es</m> and <m>\reals</m> are both open and closed since they are compliments of each other and are both open by the definition of a topology.
            Now suppose that <m>U</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\reals</m> that is both open and closed.
            Suppose also that <m>U \neq \reals</m> so that <m>U \pss \reals</m> and hence there is a
            <m>y \in \reals</m> where <m>y \notin U</m>.
            We show that the existence of such a <m>U</m> results in a contradiction,
            which of course shows the desired result since it implies that
            <m>U = \reals</m> if <m>U \neq \es</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> is nonempty we have that there is an <m>x \in U</m> and it must be that
            <m>x \neq y</m> since <m>x \in U</m> but <m>y \notin U</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>x \lt y</m> then define the set <m>A = \braces{z > x \where z \notin U}</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>A</m> is nonempty since <m>y \in A</m>,
            and that <m>x</m> is a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            It then follows that <m>A</m> has a largest lower bound <m>a</m> since this is a fundamental property of <m>\reals</m>.
            It could be that <m>a \in U</m> or <m>a \notin U</m>.
            In the former case we have that any basis element <m>(c,d)</m> containing <m>a</m> is not a subset of <m>U</m>.
            To see this, we have that <m>c \lt a \lt d</m>,
            which means that <m>d</m> is not a lower bound of <m>A</m> since <m>a</m> is the largest lower bound.
            Hence there is a <m>z \in A</m> where <m>d > z</m>.
            We then have <m>c \lt a \leq z \lt d</m>
            (noting that <m>a \leq z</m> since <m>a</m> is a lower bound of <m>A</m>)
            so <m>z \in (c,d)</m> and <m>z \in A</m> so that <m>z \notin U</m>.
            Hence <m>(c,d)</m> is not a subset of <m>U</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>U</m> is open since the basis element <m>(c,d)</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the latter case where <m>a \notin U</m> then it has to be that <m>x \lt a</m> since <m>x</m> is a lower bound of <m>A</m> and <m>a</m> is the largest lower bound
            (and it cannot be that <m>a = x</m> since <m>x \in U</m> but <m>a \notin U</m>).
            We clearly have that <m>a \in \reals - U</m>,
            which is open since <m>U</m> is closed.
            Now consider any basis element <m>(c,d)</m> containing <m>a</m> so that <m>c \lt a \lt d</m>.
            Let <m>b = \max(x,c)</m> so that <m>b \lt a</m> and hence there is a real <m>z</m> where
            <m>c \leq b \lt z \lt a \lt d</m> and hence <m>z \in (c,d)</m>.
            Now, since <m>z \lt a</m> it has to be that
            <m>z \notin A</m> since otherwise <m>a</m> would not be a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            We also have that <m>x \leq b \lt z</m> so that it has to be that <m>z \in U</m> since otherwise it would be that <m>z \in A</m>.
            Thus <m>z \notin \reals - U</m>,
            which shows that <m>(c,d)</m> is not a subset of
            <m>\reals - U</m> since <m>z \in (c,d)</m>.
            Since <m>(c,d)</m> was an arbitrary basis element,
            this contradicts the fact that <m>\reals - U</m> is open.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was thus shown that in either case a contradiction arises.
            Analogous arguments also show contradictions when <m>x > y</m>,
            this time using the set <m>A = \braces{z \lt x \where z \notin U}</m> and its least upper bound.
            Hence it has to be that <m>U = \reals</m>,
            which shows the desired result.

          <em>Main Problem.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Recall that by the definition of the one-sided limit,
          <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m> is continuous from the right if,
          for every <m>a \in \reals</m> and every <m>\e > 0</m>,
          there is a <m>\d > 0</m> such that
          <m>\abs{f(x) - f(a)} \lt \e</m> for every <m>x > a</m> where <m>\abs{x-a} \lt \d</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            So suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous from the right and consider any <m>a \in \reals</m>.
            Let <m>V</m> be neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>\reals</m>.
            Then there is a basis element <m>(c,d)</m> of <m>\reals</m> that contains <m>f(a)</m> and is a subset of <m>V</m>.
            Hence <m>c \lt f(a) \lt d</m>,
            so let <m>\e = \min[f(a)-c, d - f(a)]</m> so that clearly <m>\e > 0</m> and if <m>\abs{y - f(a)} \lt \e</m>,
            then <m>y \in (c,d)</m> so that also <m>y \in V</m>.
            Now, since <m>f</m> is continuous from the right,
            there is a <m>\d > 0</m> such that
            <m>\abs{f(x) - f(a)} \lt \e</m> for every <m>x > a</m> where <m>\abs{x-a} \lt \d</m>.
            So let <m>U = \clop{a, a+\d}</m> which is clearly a basis element of <m>\realsl</m> and contains <m>a</m> so that it is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>y \in f(U)</m> so that there is an <m>x \in U</m> where <m>y = f(x)</m>.
            If <m>x = a</m> then clearly
            <m>\abs{f(x) - f(a)} = \abs{f(a) - f(a)} = \abs{0} = 0 \lt \e</m> so that <m>f(x) \in V</m>.
            If <m>x \neq a</m> then it has to be that <m>x > a</m> and also that
            <m>\abs{x-a} = x - a \lt \d</m> since <m>U = \clop{a,a+\d}</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\abs{f(x) - f(a)} \lt \e</m> so that again <m>f(x) \in V</m>.
            Hence in both cases <m>y = f(x) \in V</m>,
            which shows that <m>f(U) \ss V</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            We have thus shown part<nbsp/>(4) of Theorem<nbsp/>18.1, from which the topological continuity of <m>f</m> follows.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) We claim that only constant functions are continuous from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\realsl</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it was shown in Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(a) that constant functions are always continuous regardless of the topologies.
            Hence we must show that any continuous function from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\realsl</m> is constant.
            So suppose that <m>f</m> is such a function.
            Now consider any real <m>x</m> where <m>x \neq 0</m>.
            Clearly if <m>f(x) = f(0)</m> then <m>f</m> is a constant function since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            So suppose that this is not the case so that <m>f(x) \neq f(0)</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that <m>f(0) \lt f(x)</m>.
            So consider the basis element <m>B = \clop{f(0), f(x)}</m> of <m>\realsl</m>,
            which clearly contains <m>f(0)</m> but not <m>f(x)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>f</m> is continuous and <m>B</m> is both open and closed by <xref ref="lem_cont_Rlopcl">Lemma</xref>,
            it follows from the definition of continuity and from Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(3) that
            <m>\inv{f}(B)</m> must be both open and closed in <m>\reals</m>.
            However the only sets that are both open and closed in <m>\reals</m> are <m>\es</m> and <m>\reals</m> itself by <xref ref="lem_cont_Ropcl">Lemma</xref>.
            Thus either <m>\inv{f}(B) = \es</m> or <m>\inv{f}(B) = \reals</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>\inv{f}(B) = \es</m> since we have that
            <m>f(0) \in B</m> so that <m>0 \in \inv{f}(B)</m>.
            Hence it must be that <m>\inv{f}(B) = \reals</m>,
            but then we would have <m>x \in \inv{f}(B)</m> so that <m>f(x) \in B</m>,
            which we know it not the case.
            We therefore have a contradiction so that it must be that
            <m>f(x) = f(0)</m> so that <m>f</m> is constant.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly, we claim that the only functions that are continuous from <m>\realsl</m> to <m>\realsl</m> are those that are
          <em>continuous and non-decreasing from the right</em>.
          For a function <m>f:\reals \to \reals</m> this means that for every
          <m>x \in \reals</m> and every <m>\e > 0</m> there is a <m>\d > 0</m> such that <m>\abs{f(y) - f(x)} \lt \e</m> and
          <m>f(y) \geq f(x)</m> for every <m>x \leq y \lt x + \d</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that such functions are in fact continuous.
            So suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous and non-decreasing from the right and consider any real <m>x</m>.
            Let <m>V</m> be any neighborhood of <m>f(x)</m> so that there is a basis element
            <m>B = \clop{c,d}</m> containing <m>f(x)</m> such that <m>B \ss V</m>.
            Let <m>\e = d - f(x)</m> so that <m>\e > 0</m> since <m>f(x) \lt d</m>.
            Hence there is a <m>\d > 0</m> such that <m>x \lt y \lt x+\d</m> implies that
            <m>\abs{f(y)-f(x)} \lt \e</m> and <m>f(y) \geq f(x)</m>.
            We then have that <m>U = \clop{x, x+\d}</m> is a basis element and therefore an open set of <m>\realsl</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
            Consider any <m>z \in f(U)</m> so that
            <m>z = f(y)</m> for some <m>y \in U</m>.
            Then <m>x \leq y \lt x+\d</m> so that
            <m>z = f(y) \geq f(x)</m> and <m>\abs{z - f(x)} = \abs{f(y)-f(x)} \lt \e</m>.
            It then follows that <m>0 \leq z - f(x) \lt \e</m> so that <m>c \leq f(x) \leq z \lt f(x) + \e = d</m>,
            and hence <m>z \in \clop{c,d} = B</m>.
            Thus also <m>z \in V</m> since <m>B \ss V</m>.
            This shows that <m>f(U) \ss V</m> since <m>z</m> was arbitrary,
            and hence that <m>f</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that a continuous function <em>must</em>
            be continuous and non-decreasing from the right by showing the contrapositive.
            So suppose that <m>f</m> is not continuous and non-decreasing from the right.
            Then there exists a real <m>x</m> and an <m>\e > 0</m> such that,
            for any <m>\d > 0</m>,
            there is a <m>x \leq y \lt x+\d</m> where
            <m>f(y) \lt f(x)</m> or <m>\abs{f(y)-f(x)} \geq \e</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>V = \clop{f(x),
            f(x)+\e}</m> is basis element and therefore open set of <m>\realsl</m> that contains <m>f(x)</m>.
            Consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> so that there is a basis element
            <m>B = \clop{a,b}</m> containing <m>x</m> where <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Then <m>x \lt b</m> so that <m>\d = b - x > 0</m>.
            It then follows that there is a <m>x \leq y \lt x+\d = b</m> such that
            <m>f(y) \lt f(x)</m> or <m>\abs{f(y) - f(x)} \geq \e</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>y \in B</m> so that also <m>y \in U</m> and <m>f(y) \in f(U)</m>.
            However, if <m>f(y) \lt f(x)</m> then clearly <m>f(y) \notin V</m>.
            On the other hand if <m>f(y) \geq f(x)</m> then it has to be that <m>\abs{f(y) - f(x)} \geq \e</m>.
            Then we have that <m>f(y) - f(x) \geq 0</m> so that <m>f(y) - f(x) = \abs{f(y) - f(x)} \geq \e</m>,
            and hence <m>f(y) \geq f(x) + \e</m> so that again <m>f(y) \notin V</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>f(U)</m> is not a subset of <m>V</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is not continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>x</m>.

          (a) First let <m>C = \braces{x \in X \where f(x) \leq g(x)}</m> so that we must show that <m>C</m> is closed in <m>X</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We prove this by showing that the complement <m>X - C</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
            So first let <m>S</m> be the set of all <m>y \in Y</m> where <m>y</m> has an immediate successor,
            and denote that successor by <m>y+1</m>.
            Then clearly <m>y+1</m> is well defined for all <m>y \in S</m>.
            Now define
            <md>
              <mrow>A_{>y} \amp = \braces{z \in Y \where z > y} \amp A_{\lt y} \amp = \braces{z \in Y \where z \lt  y+1}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>y \in S</m>.
            As these are both rays in the order topology <m>Y</m>,
            they are both basis elements and therefore open.
            It then follows that <m>\inv{f}(A_{>y})</m> and
            <m>\inv{g}(A_{\lt y})</m> are both open in <m>X</m> since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous.
            Hence their intersection <m>U_y = \inv{f}(A_{>y}) \cap \inv{g}(A_{\lt y})</m> is also open in <m>X</m>.
          </p>

            We claim that <m>X -C = D</m> so that the complement is open in <m>X</m> and hence <m>C</m> is closed as desired.

            <m>(\ss)</m> First consider any
            <m>x \in X - C</m> so that clearly <m>f(x) > g(x)</m>.
            If <m>g(x)</m> has an immediate successor <m>g(x)+1</m> then <m>g(x) \in S</m> and we have
            <m>f(x) \in A_{>g(x)}</m> so that <m>x \in \inv{f}(A_{>g(x)})</m>.
            We also have that <m>g(x) \in A_{\lt g(x)}</m> since <m>g(x) \lt g(x)+1</m>,
            and hence <m>x \in \inv{g}(A_{\lt g(x)})</m>.
            It then follows that <m>x \in U_{g(x)}</m> and hence
            <m>\bigcup_{y \in S} U_y</m> and <m>x \in D</m> since <m>g(x) \in S</m>.
            If <m>g(x)</m> does not have an immediate successor then there must be a <m>y \in Y</m> where <m>g(x) \lt y \lt f(x)</m>.
            We then have that clearly <m>f(x) \in B_{>y}</m> and <m>g(x) \in B_{\lt y}</m> so that
            <m>x \in \inv{f}(B_{>y})</m> and <m>x \in \inv{g}(B_{\lt y})</m>.
            Thus <m>x \in V_y</m> so that <m>x \in \bigcup_{y \in Y} V_y</m> and <m>x \in D</m>.
            This shows that <m>X - C \ss D</m> since either way <m>x \in D</m> and <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now suppose that <m>x \in D</m>.
            If <m>x \in \bigcup_{y \in S} U_y</m> when there is a <m>y \in S</m> where <m>x \in U_y</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in \inv{f}(A_{>y})</m> and <m>x \in \inv{g}(A_{\lt y})</m> so that
            <m>f(x) \in A_{>y}</m> and <m>g(x) \in A_{\lt y}</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>f(x) > y</m> and <m>g(x) \lt y+1</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>g(x) \leq y</m> so that <m>f(x) > y \geq g(x)</m>.
            If <m>x \in \bigcup_{y \in Y} V_y</m> then there is a <m>y \in Y</m> where <m>x \in V_y</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in \inv{f}(B_{>y})</m> and <m>x \in \inv{g}(B_{\lt y})</m> so that
            <m>f(x) \in B_{>y}</m> and <m>g(x) \in B_{\lt y}</m>.
            It then clearly follows that <m>f(x) > y</m> and
            <m>g(x) \lt y</m> so that <m>f(x) > y > g(x)</m>.
            Therefore in either case we have
            <m>f(x) > g(x)</m> so that <m>x \in X - C</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>X - C \sps D</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.

            Let <m>A = \braces{x \in X \where f(x) \leq g(x)}</m> and <m>B = \braces{x \in X \where g(x) \leq f(x)}</m>,
            which are clearly both closed by part<nbsp/>(a).
            It is easy to see that <m>X = A \cup B</m>.
            First, clearly <m>X \sps A \cup B</m> since both <m>A \ss X</m> and <m>B \ss X</m>.
            Then, for any <m>x \in X</m>,
            it has to be that either <m>f(x) \leq g(x)</m> or
            <m>f(x) > g(x)</m> since <m>\lt</m> is a total order on <m>Y</m>.
            In the former case of course <m>x \in A</m>,
            and in the latter <m>x \in B</m> so that either way <m>x \in A \cup B</m>.
            Hence <m>X \ss A \cup B</m>.
            It is also easy to see that
            <m>f(x) = g(x)</m> for every <m>x \in A \cap B</m>.
            For any such <m>x</m>,
            we have that <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>f(x) \leq g(x)</m>,
            and <m>x \in B</m> so that <m>g(x) \leq f(x)</m>.
            From this it clearly must be that <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous,
            it then follows from the pasting lemma that the function
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = \begin{cases}f(x) \amp  x \in A \\ g(x) \amp  x \in B \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>x \in X</m> is continuous as well.
            Based on the definitions of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> it is then easy to see and trivial to show that
            <m>h(x) = \min\braces{f(x),
            g(x)}</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>,

        <proof>
          <p>
            We show using induction that <m>f</m> is continuous for any collection <m>\braces{A_\a}_{\a=1}^n</m>,
            for any <m>n \in \pints</m>, where each <m>A_\a</m> is closed.
            This of course shows the desired result since the collection is
            <m>\braces{A_\a}_{\a=1}^n</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m> if it is finite.
            So first, for <m>n=1</m>,
            we have that <m>A_1 = \bigcup_{\a=1}^n A_\a = X</m> so that of course <m>f = f \rest X = f \rest A_1</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous for any collection of size <m>n</m> and suppose we have the collection <m>\braces{A_\a}_{\a=1}^{n+1}</m> of size <m>n+1</m>.
            Let <m>A = \bigcup_{\a=1}^n A_\a</m>,
            which is closed by Theorem<nbsp/>17.1 since each <m>A_\a</m> is closed and it is a finite union,
            and let <m>B = A_{n+1}</m> so that <m>B</m> is also closed.
            We then have that <m>A \cup B = \bigcup_{\a=1}^n A_\a \cup A_{n+1} = \bigcup_{\a=1}^{n+1} A_\a = X</m>.
            We know that <m>g = f \rest B = f \rest A_{n+1}</m> is continuous.
            Considering the set <m>A</m> as a subspace of <m>X</m>,
            then each <m>A_\a</m> for <m>\a \in \intsfin{n}</m> is closed in <m>A</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.2 since they are subsets of <m>A</m> and closed in <m>X</m>.
            Since by definition <m>\bigcup_{\a=1}^n A_\a = A</m>,
            it follows from the induction hypothesis that <m>f' = f \rest A</m> is continuous.
            Clearly also for any <m>x \in A \cap B</m> we have that <m>x \in A</m> and
            <m>x \in B = A_{n+1}</m> so that <m>f'(x) = (f \rest A)(x) = f(x) = (f \rest A_{n+1})(x) = g(x)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then by the pasting lemma the function <m>h : X \to Y</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = \begin{cases}f'(x) \amp  x \in A \\ g(x) \amp  x \in B \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            is continuous.
            However, consider any <m>x \in X</m>.
            If <m>x \in A</m> then <m>h(x) = f'(x) = (f \rest A)(x) = f(x)</m>.
            Similarly if <m>x \in B</m> then <m>h(x) = g(x) = (f \rest B)(x) = f(x)</m> as well.
            This suffices to show that <m>h = f</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            Thus <m>f</m> is continuous, which completes the induction.

          (b) Consider the standard topology on <m>\reals</m> and define the countable collection of set <m>\braces{A_n}</m> by

          </md>
          for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
          Also define <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m> by
          <md>
            <mrow>f(x) = \begin{cases}1 \amp  x \leq 0 \\ 0 \amp  x > 0 \end{cases}</mrow>
          </md>
          for real <m>x</m>.
          We claim that this collection and function have the desired properties.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it is trivial to show that the collection covers all of <m>\reals</m>,
            i.e. that <m>\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n = \reals</m>.
            It is also obvious by this point that each <m>A_n</m> is closed in the standard topology.
            Clearly <m>f</m> is not a continuous function since there is a discontinuity at <m>x = 0</m>,
            which is trivial to prove.
            Lastly, consider any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>n = 1</m> then for any <m>x \in A_n = A_1 = \opcl{-\infty, 0}</m> we have that
            <m>x \leq 0</m> and hence <m>f(x) = 1</m>.
            Likewise if <m>n = 2</m> then for any <m>x \in A_n = A_2 = \clop{1, \infty}</m> it follows that
            <m>x \geq 1 > 0</m> , and hence <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
            Lastly, if <m>n > 2</m> then for any <m>x \in A_n = [1/(n-1), 1/(n-2)]</m> we have that
            <m>0 \lt 1/(n-1) \leq x</m> so that <m>f(x) = 0</m> again.
            Thus in all cases <m>f \rest A_n</m> is constant and therefore continuous.
            This shows the desired properties.
          </p>
        </proof>

          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in X</m> so that there is a neighborhood <m>U'</m> of <m>x</m> that intersects a finite subcollection
            <m>\braces{A_k}_{k=1}^n</m> of the full collection <m>\braces{A_\a}</m>.
            Consider <m>A = \bigcup_{k=1}^n A_k</m> as a subspace of <m>X</m>,
            from which it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>17.2 that each <m>A_k</m> is closed in <m>A</m> since it is a subset of <m>A</m> and closed in <m>X</m>.
            It is then easy to show that <m>U' \ss A</m>.
            It also follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that
            <m>f \rest A</m> is continuous with the domain being the subspace topology on <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>f(x)</m>,
            noting that of course <m>x \in A</m> since <m>x \in U'</m> and <m>U' \ss A</m>.
            Thus <m>f(x)</m> is in the image of
            <m>f \rest A</m> so that there is a neighborhood <m>U_A</m> of <m>x</m> in the subspace topology such that
            <m>(f \rest A)(U_A) \ss V</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>f \rest A</m> is continuous.
            Since <m>U_A</m> is open in the subspace topology,
            there is an open set <m>U_X</m> in <m>X</m> where <m>U_A = A \cap U_X</m>.
            Now let <m>U = U' \cap U_X</m>,
            which is open in <m>X</m> since <m>U'</m> and <m>U_X</m> are both open in <m>X</m>.
            Then also <m>x \in U_X</m> since
            <m>x \in U_A</m> and <m>U_A = A \cap U_X</m>,
            and hence <m>x \in U</m> since also
            <m>x \in U'</m> and <m>U = U' \cap U_X</m>.
            Thus <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> in <m>X</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>z</m> be any element of <m>f(U)</m> so that
            <m>z = f(y)</m> for some <m>y \in U</m>.
            Then <m>y \in U'</m> and <m>y \in U_X</m> since <m>U = U' \cap U_X</m>.
            Then also <m>y \in A</m> since <m>U' \ss A</m>,
            and hence <m>y \in A \cap U_X = U_A</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>z = f(y) = (f \rest A)(y) \in (f \rest A)(U_A)</m> so that <m>z \in V</m> since <m>(f \rest A)(U_A) \ss V</m>.
            Since <m>z</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f(U) \ss V</m>,
            which in turn shows that <m>f</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>V</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>x</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>X</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          We note that the example in part<nbsp/>(b) is not locally finite since any neighborhood of <m>x = 0</m> intersects infinitely many <m>A_n</m> in the collection.
          This fact is easy to see and would be easy to prove formally,

            Consider any <m>\xy \in A \times C</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of
            <m>(\fg)(\xy)</m> in <m>B \times D</m>.
            Since <m>V</m> is open in <m>B \times D</m>,
            there is a basis element <m>U_B \times U_D</m> of the product topology that contains

            Then <m>U_B</m> and <m>U_D</m> are open in <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>,
            respectively.
            Since <m>f</m> is continuous,
            we then have that <m>U_A = \inv{f}(U_B)</m> is open in <m>A</m>.
            Likewise <m>U_C = \inv{g}(U_D)</m> is open in <m>C</m> since <m>g</m> is continuous.
            Then the set <m>U = U_A \times U_C</m> is a basis element of the product topology <m>A \times C</m> and therefore open.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>U_B \times U_D</m> contains <m>(\fg)(\xy) = f(x) \times g(y)</m> we have that
            <m>f(x) \in U_B</m> and <m>g(y) \in U_D</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>x \in \inv{f}(U_B) = U_A</m> and <m>y \in \inv{g}(U_D) = U_C</m>.
            Therefore <m>\xy \in U_A \times U_C = U</m> so that <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>\xy</m> in <m>A \times C</m>.
            Now consider any <m>\wz \in (\fg)(U)</m> so that there is an
            <m>\xyp \in U = U_A \times U_C</m> where <m>\wz = (\fg)(\xyp) = f(x') \times g(y')</m>.
            Hence <m>w = f(x')</m> and
            <m>x' \in U_A = \inv{f}(U_B)</m> so that <m>w = f(x') \in U_B</m>.
            Similarly <m>z = g(y')</m> and
            <m>y' \in U_C = \inv{g}(U_D)</m> so that <m>z = g(y') \in U_D</m>.
            Thus <m>\wz \in U_B \times U_D</m> so that also
            <m>\wz \in V</m> since <m>U_B \times U_D \ss V</m>.
            This shows that <m>(\fg)(U) \ss V</m> since <m>\wz</m> was arbitrary.

            This suffices to show that <m>\fg</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 as desired.

          the map <m>k: Y \to Z</m> defined by <m>k(y) = F(x_0 \times y)</m> is continuous.
          Show that if <m>F</m> is continuous,
          then <m>F</m> is continuous in each variable separately.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            To show that <m>F</m> is continuous in <m>x</m>,
            consider any <m>y_0 \in Y</m> and define
            <m>h: X \to Z</m> by <m>h(x) = F(x \times y_0)</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x \in X</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>h(x) = F(x \times y_0)</m>.
            Then <m>V</m> is an open set containing
            <m>h(x) = F(x \times y_0)</m> so that it is a neighborhood of <m>F(x \times y_0)</m>.
            Since <m>F</m> is continuous,
            this means that there is neighborhood <m>U'</m> of
            <m>x \times y_0</m> in <m>X \times Y</m> such that
            <m>F(U') \ss V</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1.
            It then follows that there is a basis element
            <m>U_X \times U_Y</m> of <m>X \times Y</m> containing
            <m>x \times y_0</m> where <m>U_X \times U_Y \ss U'</m>.
            Since <m>X \times Y</m> is a product topology,
            we have that <m>U_X</m> is open in <m>X</m> and <m>U_Y</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.
            Then, since <m>x \times y_0 \in U_X \times U_Y</m> we have that <m>x \in U_X</m> and
            <m>y_0 \in U_Y</m> so that <m>U_X</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> in <m>X</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>z \in h(U_X)</m> so that
            <m>z = h(x')</m> for some <m>x' \in U_X</m>.
            Then <m>x' \times y_0 \in U_X \times U_Y</m> so that also
            <m>x' \times y_0</m> in <m>U'</m> since <m>U_X \times U_Y \ss U'</m>.
            It then also follows that <m>z = h(x') = F(x' \times y_0) \in F(U')</m> so that <m>z \in V</m> since <m>F(U') \ss V</m>.
            This shows that <m>h(U_X) \ss V</m> since <m>z</m> was arbitrary.
            It then follows that <m>h</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1.

            It is easy to see that <m>F</m> is continuous in <m>x</m>.
            For any real <m>y_0</m> we generally have that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = F(x \times y_0) = \frac{x y_0}{x^2 + y_0^2}</mrow>
            </md>
            so long as one of <m>x</m> and <m>y_0</m> are nonzero.
            If <m>y_0 = 0</m> then <m>x = 0</m> implies that
            <m>x \times y_0 = 0 \times 0</m> so that <m>h(x) = F(0 \times0) = 0</m> by definition.
            If <m>x \neq 0</m> then we have <m>h(x) = 0/x^2 = 0</m> again.
            Thus <m>h</m> is the constant function
            <m>h(x) = 0</m> and so is continuous when <m>y_0 = 0</m>.
            If <m>y_0 \neq 0</m> then <m>y_0^2 > 0</m> so that
            <m>x^2 + y_0^2 > 0</m> since also <m>x \geq 0</m>.
            Thus the denominator is never zero that the <m>h(x)</m> is given by the expression above,
            which is continuous by elementary calculus.
            Hence <m>h</m> is always continuous.
            The same arguments show that <m>F</m> is continuous in <m>y</m> as well.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider the function
            <m>f: \reals \to \reals \times \reals</m> defined simply by <m>f(x) = x \times x</m>.
            This function is clearly continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.4 since it can be expressed as
            <m>f(x) = f_1(x) \times f_2(x)</m> where the identical functions
            <m>f_1(x) = f_2(x) = x</m> are obviously continuous.
            Then <m>g = F \circ f</m>,
            where <m>g</m> is the function from part<nbsp/>(b) since we have
            <m>g(x) = F(x \times x) = F(f(x))</m> for any real <m>x</m>.
            Now, clearly <m>g</m> as calculated in part<nbsp/>(b) has a discontinuity at <m>x = 0</m> so that it is not continuous.
            It then follows from Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c) that either <m>F</m> or <m>f</m> is not continuous since <m>g = F \circ f</m>.
            As we know that the trivial function <m>f</m> is continuous,
            it must then be that <m>F</m> is not as desired.

          Show that if <m>f</m> may be extended to a continuous function <m>g: \clA \to Y</m>,
          then <m>g</m> is uniquely determined by <m>f</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> are both continuous functions from <m>\clA</m> to <m>Y</m> that extend <m>f</m> so that
            <m>g_1(x) = g_2(x) = f(x)</m> for all <m>x \in A</m>.
            Clearly <m>g_1 = g_2</m> if and only if
            <m>g_1(x) = g_2(x)</m> for all <m>x \in \clA</m>.
            So suppose that this is <em>not</em>
            the case so that there is an
            <m>x_0 \in \clA</m> where <m>g_1(x_0) \neq g_2(x_0)</m>.
            Since <m>Y</m> is a Hausdorff space and
            <m>g_1(x_0)</m> and <m>g_2(x_0)</m> are distinct,
            there are disjoint neighborhoods <m>V_1</m> and <m>V_2</m> of
            <m>g_1(x_0)</m> and <m>g_2(x_0)</m>, respectively.
            Then there are also neighborhoods <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> of <m>x_0</m> such that <m>g_1(U_1) \ss V_1</m> and
            <m>g_2(U_2) \ss V_2</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since both <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> are continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>U = U_1 \cap U_2</m> so that <m>U</m> is also a neighborhood of <m>x_0</m>.
            Since <m>x_0 \in \clA</m>,
            it follows that <m>U</m> intersects <m>A</m> so that there is a <m>y \in U</m> where also <m>y \in A</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5.
            Since <m>y \in A</m> we have that <m>g_1(y) = g_2(y) = f(y)</m>.
            We also have that <m>y \in U_1</m> and
            <m>y \in U_2</m> since <m>U = U_1 \cap U_2</m>.
            Thus <m>g_1(y) \in g_1(U_1)</m> so that
            <m>f(y) = g_1(y) \in V_1</m> since <m>g_1(U_1) \ss V_1</m>.
            Similarly <m>f(y) = g_2(y) \in V_2</m>,
            but then we have that <m>f(y) \in V_1 \cap V_2</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>V_1</m> and <m>V_2</m> are disjoint!
            Hence it must be that <m>g_1 = g_2</m>, which shows uniqueness.

        <p>
          Let <m>\cC</m> be the collection of sets that are alleged to be a basis for the box or product topologies in Theorem<nbsp/>19.2.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show that <m>\cC</m> is a basis of the box or product topology using Lemma<nbsp/>13.2.
            First, it is easy to see that <m>\cC</m> is a collection of open sets.
            Consider any <m>B \in \cC</m> so that
            <m>B = \prod B_\a</m> where each <m>B_\a \in \cB_\a</m>
            (for a finitely many <m>\a \in J</m> and
            <m>B_\a = X_\a</m> for the rest in the product topology).
            Since each <m>B_\a</m> is a basis element of <m>X_\a</m>
            (or <m>X_\a</m> itself),
            they are open so that <m>B</m> is a basis element of the box or product topology by definition and therefore open.
            Note that the basis for the product topology is given directly by Theorem<nbsp/>19.1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>U</m> is an any open set of the box topology and consider any <m>x \in U</m>.
            Then it follows that there is a basis element
            <m>\prod_{\a \in J} U_\a</m> of the box or product topology containing <m>x</m> where <m>\prod_{\a \in J} U_\a \ss U</m>.
            Thus each <m>U_\a</m> is an open set of <m>X_\a</m>
            (or <m>U_\a = X_\a</m> for all but finitely many
            <m>\a \in J</m> for the product topology).
            Also <m>x \in \prod_{\a \in J} U_\a</m> so that
            <m>x = (x_\a)_{\a \in J}</m> where each <m>x_\a \in U_\a</m>.
            It then follows that there is basis element
            <m>B_\a \in \cB_\a</m> of <m>X_\a</m> containing <m>x_\a</m> where <m>B_\a \ss U_\a</m>
            (for <m>U_\a = X_\a</m> we simply set <m>B_\a = X_\a</m> as well).
          </p>
          <p>
            Then clearly <m>x \in \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a</m> and <m>\prod_{\a \in J} B_\a \in \cC</m>.
            Consider also any <m>y \in \prod_{\a \in J} B_\a</m> so that
            <m>y = (y_\a)_{\a \in J}</m> where each <m>y_\a \in B_\a</m>.
            Then also each <m>y_\a \in U_\a</m> since <m>B_\a \ss U_\a</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>y \in \prod_{\a \in J} U_\a \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>\prod_{\a \in J} B_\a \ss U</m>.
            Therefore <m>\cC</m> is a basis of the box topology by Lemma<nbsp/>13.2.

          <p>
            The basis of the box or product topologies on
            <m>\prod A_\a</m> is the collection of sets <m>\prod V_\a</m>,
            where each <m>V_\a</m> is open in <m>A_\a</m> and,
            in the case of the product topology,
            <m>V_\a = A_\a</m> for all but finitely many <m>\a \in J</m>
            (by Theorem<nbsp/>19.1).
            Denote this basis collection by <m>\cC</m>.
            By Lemma<nbsp/>16.1, the collection
            <md>
              <mrow>\cB_A = \braces{B \cap \prod A_\a \where B \in \cB}</mrow>
            </md>
            is a basis of the subspace topology on <m>\prod A_\a</m>,
            where <m>\cB</m> is the basis of <m>\prod X_\a</m>.
            To prove that <m>\prod A_\a</m> is a subspace of <m>\prod X_\a</m>,
            it therefore suffices to show that <m>\cC = \cB_A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> First consider any element <m>B \in \cC</m> so that
            <m>B = \prod V_\a</m> for open sets <m>V_\a</m> in <m>A_\a</m>
            (and <m>V_\a = A_\a</m> for all but finite many
            <m>\a \in J</m> for the product topology).
            For each <m>\a \in J</m>,
            we then have that <m>V_\a = U_\a \cap A_\a</m> for some open set <m>U_\a</m> in <m>X_\a</m> since <m>A_\a</m> is a subspace of <m>X_\a</m>.
            Note that this is true even for those <m>\a</m> where
            <m>V_\a = A_\a</m> in the product topology since then <m>V_\a = A_\a = X_\a \cap A_\a</m>.
            In fact, for these <m>\a</m> we need to choose

            Since <m>U_\a = X_\a</m> for all but a finitely many
            <m>\a \in J</m> for the product topology,
            we have that <m>\prod U_\a</m> is a basis element of <m>\prod X_\a</m>, i.e.
            <m>\prod U_\a \in \cB</m>.
            This shows that <m>B \in \cB_A</m> so that
            <m>\cC \ss \cB_A</m> since <m>B</m> was arbitrary.

            <m>B_X \in \cB</m> of <m>\prod X_\a</m>.
            We then have that <m>B_X = \prod U_\a</m> where each <m>U_\a</m> is an open set of <m>X_\a</m>
            (and <m>U_\a = X_\a</m> for all but finitely many
            <m>\a \in J</m> for the product topology).
            Then let <m>V_\a = U_\a \cap A_\a</m> for each <m>\a \in J</m>,
            noting that <m>V_\a = X_\a \cap A_\a = A_\a</m> when <m>U_\a = X_\a</m>.
            Following the above chain of logical equivalences in reverse order then shows that <m>B = \prod V_\a</m> so that
            <m>B \in \cC</m> since clearly each <m>V_\a</m> is open in the subspace topology <m>A_\a</m>.
            Hence <m>\cC \sps \cB_A</m> since <m>B</m> was arbitrary.

          Prove Theorem<nbsp/>19.4.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are distinct points of <m>\prod X_\a</m>.
            Then <m>x = (x_a)</m> and <m>y = (y_\a)</m> where each <m>x_\a, y_\a \in X_\a</m>,
            and there must be a <m>\b</m> where
            <m>x_\b \neq y_\b</m> since <m>x \neq y</m>.
            Thus <m>x_\b</m> and <m>y_\b</m> are distinct points of <m>X_\b</m>,
            so that there are neighborhoods <m>W_x</m> and <m>W_y</m> of <m>x_\b</m> and <m>y_\b</m>,
            respectively,
            that are disjoint since <m>X_\b</m> is a Hausdorff space.
            So define the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>U_\a \amp = \begin{cases} W_x \amp  \a = \b</mrow>
              <mrow>X_\a \amp  \a \neq \b \end{cases} \amp V_\a \amp = \begin{cases} W_y \amp  \a = \b</mrow>
              <mrow>X_\a \amp  \a \neq \b \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            so that clearly <m>x \in \prod U_\a</m> and <m>y \in \prod V_\a</m>.
            Then since each <m>U_\a</m> and <m>V_\a</m> are open,
            we have that <m>\prod U_\a</m> and
            <m>\prod V_\a</m> are both basis elements of <m>\prod X_\a</m> and therefore open.
            Note that this is true for both the box and product topologies since,
            in the case of the latter,
            <m>U_\a</m> and <m>V_\a</m> are not all of <m>X_\a</m> for only one <m>\a</m>,
            namely <m>\a = \b</m>.
            Thus <m>\prod U_\a</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> and
            <m>\prod V_\a</m> is a neighborhood of <m>y</m> in <m>\prod X_\a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also assert that <m>\prod U_\a</m> and <m>\prod V_\a</m> are disjoint,
            which of course completes the proof that <m>\prod X_\a</m> is Hausdorff.
            To see this,
            suppose to the contrary that there is a <m>z</m> in both
            <m>\prod U_\a</m> and <m>\prod V_\a</m>.
            Then <m>z = (z_\a)</m> and in particular we would have that
            <m>z_\b \in U_\b = W_x</m> and <m>z_\b \in V_\b = W_y</m>.
            But then <m>z_\b \in W_x \cap W_y</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>W_x</m> and <m>W_y</m> are disjoint!
            So it must be that in fact
            <m>\prod U_\a</m> and <m>\prod V_\a</m> are disjoint.

          Show that <m>\rans</m> is homeomorphic to <m>\doms</m>.

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we note that since we are dealing with finite products,
            the box and product topologies are the same;
            we shall find it most convenient to use the box topology definition.
            Also, as there are no intervals involved here,
            we use the traditional tuple notation using parentheses.
            So define <m>f: \doms  \to \rans</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}) = (\seqfin{x}{n-1}, x_n) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is obvious that this is a bijection,
            and it is trivial to prove.
            Also obvious and trivial to prove based on the definition of <m>f</m> is that
            <m>f(\cpfin{A}{n}) = (\cpfin{A}{n-1}) \times A_n</m> when each <m>A_k \ss X_k</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>f</m> is continuous by showing that the inverse image of every basis element in <m>\rans</m> is open in <m>\doms</m>.
            So consider any basis element <m>C</m> of <m>\rans</m> and let <m>U = \inv{f}(C)</m> so that of course
            <m>f(U) = C</m> and <m>U \ss \doms</m>.
            We then have that <m>C = V' \times V_n</m> where <m>V'</m> is open in
            <m>\cpfin{X}{n-1}</m> and <m>V_n</m> is open in <m>X_n</m> by the definition of the box/product topology.
            Now consider any <m>x \in U</m> so that
            <m>x = \seqfin{x}{n}</m> and we have that <m>f(x) = (\seqfin{x}{n-1}, x_n) \in f(U) = C</m>.
            Hence <m>x' = \seqfin{x}{n-1} \in V'</m> and <m>x_n \in V_n</m>.
            Since <m>V'</m> is open in
            <m>\cpfin{X}{n-1}</m> there is a basis element <m>C'</m> containing <m>x'</m> that is a subset of <m>V'</m>.
            By the definition of the box topology,
            we then have that <m>C' = \cpfin{V}{n-1}</m> where each <m>V_k</m> is open in <m>X_k</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have that <m>B = \cpfin{V}{n}</m> is a basis element of <m>\doms</m> and also clearly <m>B</m> contains <m>x</m> since
            <m>\seqfin{x}{n-1} = x' \in C' = \cpfin{V}{n-1}</m> and <m>x_n \in V_n</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>y = \seqfin{y}{n} \in B</m> so that each <m>y_k \in V_k</m>.
            Then we have that <m>y' = \seqfin{y}{n-1} \in C'</m> so that also
            <m>y' \in V'</m> since <m>C' \ss V'</m>.
            Since also of course <m>y_n \in V_n</m>,
            we have that <m>(y', y_n) \in V' \times V_n = C</m>.
            Also clearly <m>f(y) = (y', y_n) \in C = f(U)</m> so that <m>y \in U</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>B \ss U</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>U</m> is open since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            This completes the proof that <m>f</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that <m>\inv{f}</m> is continuous,
            which is a little simpler.
            Let <m>B</m> be any basis element of <m>\doms</m> so that
            <m>B = \cpfin{U}{n}</m> where each <m>U_k</m> is open in <m>X_k</m> by the definition of the box topology.
            Then we have that <m>f(B) = (\cpfin{U}{n-1}) \times U_n</m>.
            By the definition of the box topology,
            we then have that <m>U' = \cpfin{U}{n-1}</m> is a basis element of
            <m>\cpfin{X}{n-1}</m> and is therefore open.
            Since <m>U_n</m> is also open,
            we have that <m>f(B) = U' \times U_n</m> is a basis element of <m>\rans</m> by the definition of the box/product topology,
            and is therefore open.
            Since <m>f(B) = \inv{(\inv{f})}(B)</m> is the inverse image of <m>B</m> under <m>\inv{f}</m>,
            this shows that <m>\inv{f}</m> is also continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have shown that both <m>f</m> and <m>\inv{f}</m> are continuous,
            which proves that <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism by definition.

          One of the implications stated in Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 holds for the box topology.

        <p>
          Example 19.2 gives a function <m>f</m> that is not continuous in the box topology even though all of its constituent functions <m>f_\a</m> are continuous.
          Hence the only implication that can be generally true in the box topology is that <m>f</m> being continuous implies that each <m>f_\a</m> is continuous.
          A proof of this is straightforward.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As in Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 suppose that <m>f: A \to \prod_{\a \in J} X_\a</m> be given by
            <md>
              <mrow>f(a) = (f_\a(a))_{\a \in J} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where <m>f_\a: A \to X_\a</m> for each <m>\a \in J</m>.
            Here <m>\prod X_\a</m> has the box topology.
            Suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous and consider any <m>\b \in J</m>.
            We show that <m>f_\b</m> is continuous,
            which of course shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let <m>V</m> be any open set of <m>X_\b</m> and define
            <md>
              <mrow>B_\a = \begin{cases}V \amp  \a = \b \\ X_\a \amp  \a \neq \b \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, since each <m>B_\a</m> is clearly open in <m>X_\a</m>,
            we have that <m>B = \prod B_\a</m> is a basis element of the box topology by definition and is therefore open.
            Hence <m>U = \inv{f}(B)</m> is open in <m>A</m> since <m>f</m> is continuous.
            We claim that <m>U = \inv{f_\b}(V)</m>,
            which shows that <m>f_\b</m> is continuous since <m>U</m> is open in <m>A</m> and <m>V</m> was an arbitrary open set of <m>X_\b</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> If <m>x \in U = \inv{f}(B)</m> then of course
            <m>f(x) \in B</m> so that each <m>f_\a(x) \in B_\a</m> since
            <m>f(x) = (f_\a(x))_{\a \in J}</m> and <m>B = \prod B_\a</m>.
            In particular <m>f_\b(x) \in B_\b = V</m> so that <m>x \in \inv{f_\b}(V)</m>.
            Hence <m>U \ss \inv{f_\b}(V)</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> If <m>x \in \inv{f_\b}(V)</m> then <m>f_\b(x) \in V = B_\b</m>.
            Since of course every other
            <m>f_\a(x) \in X_\a = B_\a</m> we have that <m>f(x) \in \prod B_\a = B</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in \inv{f}(B) = U</m> so that
            <m>\inv{f_\b}(V) \ss U</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.

            so that <m>B = \prod B_\a</m> is a basis element of
            <m>\prod X_\a</m> since each <m>B_\a</m> is open.
            Note that <m>B</m> is a basis element of both the box and product topologies since possibly
            <m>B_\a \neq X_\a</m> for only one <m>\a</m> (i.e. for <m>\a = \b</m>).
            We also clearly have that <m>\vx \in B</m> so that <m>B</m> is a neighborhood of <m>\vx</m> in <m>\prod X_\a</m>.
            Since the sequence <m>\vx_1, \vx_2, \ldots</m> converges to <m>\vx</m>,
            we have that there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where
            <m>\vx_n \in B</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
            So consider any such <m>n \geq N</m> so that <m>\vx_n \in B = \prod B_\a</m>.
            Hence <m>\pi_\a(\vx_n) \in B_\a</m> for all <m>\a</m>,
            and in particular <m>\pi_\b(\vx_n) \in B_\b = U</m>.
            This suffices to show that the sequence <m>\pi_\b(\vx_1), \pi_\b(\vx_2), \ldots</m> converges to

            Let <m>U</m> be any neighborhood of <m>\vx</m> in <m>\prod X_\a</m>.
            Then there is a basis element <m>B = \prod U_\a</m> of
            <m>\prod X_\a</m> where <m>\vx \in B</m> and <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>\prod X_\a</m> is the product topology,
            each <m>U_\a</m> is open but only a finite number of them are different from <m>X_\a</m>.
            Suppose then that <m>J</m> is the index set of <m>\a</m> and that <m>I \ss J</m> is the finite subset where
            <m>U_\a = X_\a</m> for all <m>\a \notin I</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then for any <m>\b \in I</m> we have that
            <m>\pi_\b(\vx) \in U_\b</m> since <m>\vx \in B = \prod U_\a</m>,
            hence <m>U_\b</m> is a neighborhood of <m>\pi_\b(\vx)</m>.
            Then, since <m>\pi_\b(\vx_1), \pi_\b(\vx_2), \ldots</m> converges to <m>\pi_\b(\vx)</m>,
            there is an <m>N_\b \in \pints</m> where
            <m>\pi_\b(\vx_n) \in U_\b</m> for all <m>n \geq N_\b</m>.
            So let <m>N = \max_{\a \in I} N_\a</m>,
            noting that this exists since <m>I</m> is finite.
            Consider any <m>n \geq N</m> and any <m>\a \in J</m>.
            If <m>\a \in I</m> then we have that
            <m>n \geq N \geq N_\a</m> so that <m>\pi_\a(\vx_n) \in U_\a</m>.
            If <m>\a \notin J</m> then of course we have that <m>\pi_a(\vx_n) \in X_\a = U_\a</m>.
            Hence either way we have that
            <m>\pi_\a(\vx_n) \in U_\a</m> so that <m>\vx_n \in \prod U_\a = B</m> and hence also
            <m>\vx_n \in U</m> since <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>n \geq N</m> was arbitrary and <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>\vx</m>,
            this shows that <m>\vx_1, \vx_2, \ldots</m> converges to <m>\vx</m> as desired.

        <p>
          As noted there,
          the forward direction of the preceding proof works for the product or the box topology.
          However, then reverse direction was proved only for the product topology,
          with the critical point being where we took <m>\max_{\a \in I} N_\a</m>,
          which was only guaranteed to exist since <m>I</m> is finite in the product topology.
          The provides a hint as to how to construct a counterexample that proves that this direction is not generally true for the box topology.

            Define

            </md>
            for <m>i,j \in \pints</m>.
            Now define a sequence <m>\vx_1, \vx_2, \ldots</m> in
            <m>\prod_{i \in \pints} \reals = \reals^\w</m> by <m>\pi_i(\vx_j) = x_{ij}</m>.
            With the box topology on <m>\reals^\w</m> we claim that each coordinate sequence
            <m>\pi_i(\vx_1), \pi_i(\vx_2), \ldots</m> converges to <m>0</m> but that the sequence
            <m>\vx_1, \vx_2, \ldots</m> does not converge to the point <m>\vze = (0, 0, \ldots)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it is easy to see that each coordinate sequence
            <m>\pi_i(\vx_1), \pi_i(\vx_2), \ldots</m> converges to <m>0</m> since,
            for fixed <m>i</m>,
            there is always an <m>N \in \pints</m> large enough such that <m>j > i</m> and
            <m>\pi_i(\vx_j) = x_{ij} = 1/(j-i)</m> is small enough to be within any fixed neighborhood of <m>0</m> for all <m>j \geq N</m>.
            To show that the sequence <m>\vx_1, \vx_2, \ldots</m> does not converge to <m>\vze</m> though,
            consider the neighborhood <m>U = \prod U_k</m> of <m>\vze</m> where every <m>U_k = (-1,1)</m>.
            We note that clearly <m>U</m> is open in the box topology since each <m>U_k</m> is a basis element of <m>\reals</m> and therefore open.
            For any <m>N \in \pints</m> we then have that <m>\pi_{N}(\vx_N) = x_{NN} = 1</m> so that clearly
            <m>\pi_N(\vx_N) \notin (-1, 1) = U_N</m> and hence <m>\vx_N \notin \prod U_k = U</m>.
            This suffices to show that the sequence does not converge,
            but it does not even come close to converging since there are actually no points in the sequence that are even in this quite large neighborhood of <m>\vze</m>!

          that is all sequences <m>\seqinf{x}</m> such that
          <m>x_i \neq 0</m> for only finitely many values of <m>i</m>.
          What is the closure of <m>\reals^\infty</m> in
          <m>\reals^\w</m> in the box and product topologies?
          Justify your answer.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we claim that <m>\reals^\infty</m> is dense in
          <m>\reals^\w</m> in the product topology in the sense that its closure is all of <m>\reals^\w</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show that any point of <m>\reals^\w</m> is in <m>\closure{\reals^\w}</m>.
            So consider any point <m>x = \seqinf{x} \in \reals^\w</m> and any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m>.
            Then there is a basis element
            <m>B = \prod U_n</m> containing <m>x</m> where <m>B \ss U</m>.
            By the definition of the product topology each <m>U_n</m> is open and
            <m>U_n = \reals</m> for all but finitely many values of <m>n</m>.
            So let <m>I</m> be a finite subset of <m>\pints</m> such that <m>U_n = \reals</m> for all
            <m>n \notin I</m> and <m>U_n</m> is merely just open for <m>n \in I</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider now the sequence <m>y = \seqinf{y}</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>y_n = \begin{cases}x_n \amp  n \in I \\ 0 \amp  n \notin I \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Since <m>I</m> is finite clearly <m>y \in \reals^\infty</m>.
            Also <m>y_n = x_n \in U_n</m> when <m>n \in I</m> since <m>B = \prod U_n</m> contains <m>x</m>.
            We also have <m>y_n = 0 \in \reals = U_n</m> when <m>n \notin I</m> so that either way
            <m>y_n \in U_n</m> and hence <m>y \in \prod U_n = B</m>.
            Thus also <m>y \in U</m> since <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood and <m>U</m> intersects <m>\reals^\infty</m>
            (with <m>y</m> being a point in the intersection),
            this shows that <m>x \in \closure{\reals^\infty}</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.5.
            This of course shows the desired result since <m>x</m> was any element of <m>\reals^\w</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          For the box topology,
          we claim that <m>\reals^\infty</m> is already closed.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this by showing that any point not in
            <m>\reals^\infty</m> is not a limit point of <m>\reals^\infty</m> so that
            <m>\reals^\infty</m> must already contain all its limit points.
            So consider any <m>x = \seqinf{x} \notin \reals^\infty</m> so that
            <m>x_n \neq 0</m> for infinitely many values of <m>n</m>.
            Now define the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>U_n = \begin{cases}(-1, 1) \amp  x_n = 0 \\ (x_n/2, 2x_n) \amp  x_n > 0 \\ (2x_n, x_n/2) \amp  x_n \lt  0 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly each <m>U_n</m> is a basis element of <m>\reals</m> and is therefore open.
            Also clearly each <m>x_n \in U_n</m>.
            It therefore follows that <m>B = \prod U_n</m> is a basis element of
            <m>\reals^\w</m> and is therefore open, and that <m>x \in B</m>.
            Hence <m>B</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, for any <m>y = \seqinf{y} \in B</m> we have that each <m>y_n \in U_n</m>.
            For infinitely many <m>n \in \pints</m> we then have that
            <m>x_n \neq 0</m> and hence <m>x_n > 0</m> or <m>x_n \lt 0</m>.
            In the former case <m>y_n \in U_n = (x_n/2, 2x_n)</m> so that <m>0 \lt x_n/2 \lt y_n</m>.
            In the latter case <m>y_n \in U_n = (2x_n, x_n/2)</m> so that <m>y_n \lt x_n / 2 \lt 0</m>.
            Hence either way <m>y_n \neq 0</m> so that
            <m>y \notin \reals^\infty</m> since this is true for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
            Since <m>y \in B</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>B</m> cannot not intersect <m>\reals^\infty</m>.
            Therefore <m>x</m> is not a limit point of
            <m>\reals^\infty</m> since <m>B</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any basis element <m>B = \prod V_\a</m> in
            <m>\prod Y_\a</m> so that each <m>V_\a</m> is open in <m>Y_\a</m> since we are in the box topology.
            For each <m>\a \in J</m> then define <m>U_\a = \inv{f_\a}(V_\a)</m>,
            which is open in <m>X_\a</m> since <m>f_\a</m> is continuous.
            Hence the set <m>U = \prod U_\a</m> is a basis element of
            <m>\prod X_\a</m> in the box topology and is therefore open.
            We claim that <m>U = \inv{f}(B)</m>,

        <proof>
          <p>
            First note that clearly <m>h(\vx) = (h_1(\vx),
            h_2(\vx), \ldots)</m> for <m>\vx \in \reals^\w</m>,
            where each <m>h_i : \reals^\w \to \reals</m> is defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>h_i(\vx) = a_i \pi_i(\vx) + b_i \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can further be broken down as <m>h_i(\vx) = f_i(\pi_i(\vx)) = (f_i \circ \pi_i)(\vx)</m>,
            where each <m>f_i : \reals \to \reals</m> is defined by <m>f_i(x) = a_i x + b_i</m>.
            As discussed in the proof of Theorem<nbsp/>19.6, each <m>\pi_i</m> is continuous and we have that each <m>f_i</m> is continuous by elementary calculus,
            noting that this is true whether each <m>a_i > 0</m> or not.
            It then follows from Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c) that each <m>f_i \circ \pi_i = h_i</m> is continuous.
            Then we have that <m>h</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 since each coordinate function is continuous and we are using the product topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now define the functions <m>g_i : \reals \to \reals</m> by

            noting that this is defined since each <m>a_i > 0</m>.
            Define also the functions <m>k_i : \reals^\w \to \reals</m> by <m>k_i = g_i \circ \pi_i</m>,
            and finally define <m>k : \reals^\w \to \reals^\w</m> by <m>k(\vx) = (k_1(\vx),
            k_2(\vx), \ldots)</m>.
            Now again we have that each <m>\pi_i</m> and <m>g_i</m> are continuous by the proof of Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 and elementary calculus.
            Hence <m>k_i = g_i \circ \pi_i</m> and <m>k</m> are continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c),

            Since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary,
            it thus follows from Lemma<nbsp/>2.1 that <m>h</m> is bijective and <m>k = \inv{h}</m>.
            Since we have already shown that <m>h</m> and <m>k = \inv{h}</m> are continuous,
            this suffices to prove that <m>h</m> is a homeomorphism as desired.

        <p>
          We claim that <m>h</m> is also a homeomorphism in the box topology.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, <m>h</m> is still a bijection as the proof of this above does not depend on the topology at all.
            However, Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 was used in the proofs that <m>h</m> and <m>\inv{h}</m> are continuous,
            and we know that this theorem is not generally true for the box topology.
            On the other hand <m>h</m> can be formulated as

            Since each <m>f_i</m> is continuous by elementary calculus,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_prodtop_box">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>h</m> is continuous in the box topology.

          is not empty.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For the following denote the collection <m>\braces{A_\a}_{\a \in J}</m> by <m>\cA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> First suppose that the choice axiom is true.
            Then by Lemma<nbsp/>9.2 there exists a choice function
            <md>
              <mrow>c : \cA \to \bigcup_{A \in \cA} A</mrow>
            </md>
            where <m>c(A) \in A</m> for each <m>A \in \cA</m>,
            noting that this is true since <m>\cA</m> is a collection of nonempty sets.
            Then consider, set <m>x_\a = c(A_\a)</m> for each
            <m>\a \in J</m> so that <m>x_\a = c(A_\a) \in A_\a</m>.
            Therefore clearly <m>\vx = (x_\a)_{\a \in J} \in \prod A_\a</m> so that <m>\prod A_\a</m> is not empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that
            <m>\prod_{\a \in J} A_\a</m> is nonempty for any indexed family
            <m>\braces{A_\a}_{\a \in J}</m> of nonempty sets when <m>J \neq \es</m>.
            Let <m>\cA</m> be a collection of disjoint nonempty sets where <m>\cA \neq \es</m>.
            Then the <m>\braces{A}_{A \in \cA}</m> is a nonempty family of nonempty sets.
            Hence <m>\prod_{A \in \cA} A</m> is nonempty so that there is an <m>\vx = (x_A)_{A \in \cA} \in \prod_{A \in \cA} A</m>,
            and thus <m>x_A \in A</m> for every <m>A \in \cA</m>.
            Now let <m>C = \braces{x_A}_{A \in \cA}</m> so that clearly <m>C \ss \bigcup \cA</m>.
            Consider any <m>A \in \cA</m> so that
            <m>x_A \in C</m> and <m>x_A \in A</m>,
            and hence <m>x_A \in C \cap A</m>.
            Suppose that <m>y \in C \cap A</m> so that <m>y \in C</m> and hence there is a
            <m>B \in \cA</m> where <m>y = x_B</m>.
            We also have that <m>x_B = y \in A</m>.
            If <m>B \neq A</m> then <m>x_B \in B</m> and <m>x_B \in A</m>,
            which is not possible since <m>B</m> and <m>A</m> are disjoint as they are distinct elements of <m>\cA</m>.
            So it must be that <m>B = A</m> and hence <m>y = x_B = x_A</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>C \cap A</m> has only a single element <m>x_A</m>.
            This suffices to show the choice axiom.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\cC</m> be the collection of topologies on <m>A</m> relative to which each of the functions <m>f_\a</m> is continuous.
            Clearly <m>\cC</m> is nonempty as the discrete topology is in <m>\cC</m> since every subset of <m>A</m> is open in it so that
            <m>f_\a(V_\a)</m> is always open when <m>V_\a</m> is open in <m>X_\a</m>.
            Let <m>\cT = \bigcap \cC</m>,
            which is a topology on <m>A</m> by what was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>13.4 part<nbsp/>(a).
            We claim that this is the unique coarsest topology such that each <m>f_\a</m> is continuous relative to it.
            To see this suppose that <m>\cT'</m> is any topology in such that each <m>f_\a</m> is continuous relative to it,
            hence <m>\cT' \in \cC</m>.
            Then, for any open <m>U \in \cT = \bigcap \cC</m> we of course have that
            <m>U \in \cT'</m> since <m>\cT' \in \cC</m>.
            Hence <m>\cT \ss \cT'</m> since <m>U</m> was arbitrary so that <m>\cT</m> is courser than <m>\cT'</m>,
            noting that it could of course be that <m>\cT = \cT'</m> as well.
            Since <m>\cT'</m> was artbitary,
            this shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course it also must be that <m>\cT</m> is unique since,
            for any other <m>\cT'</m> that is a coarsest element of <m>\cC</m>,
            we just showed above that <m>\cT \ss \cT'</m> since <m>\cT' \in \cC</m>.
            But also <m>\cT \sps \cT'</m> since <m>\cT'</m> must be coarser than <m>\cT</m> since <m>\cT \in \cC</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cT = \cT'</m> so that <m>\cT</m> is unique since <m>\cT'</m> was arbitrary.
            This also follows from the more general fact that any smallest element in an order or partial order is always unique,
            and inclusion is always at least a partial order.

        <proof>
          <p>
            We show that <m>\cC</m> from part<nbsp/>(a) is exactly the set of topologies on <m>A</m> that contain the subbasis <m>\cS</m>.
            That is, we show that <m>\cT' \in \cC</m> if and only if
            <m>\cS \ss \cT'</m> when <m>\cT'</m> is a topology on <m>A</m>.
            Since the coarsest topology <m>\cT</m> from part<nbsp/>(a) is defined as <m>\bigcap \cC</m>,
            this shows that <m>\cT</m> is the topology generated from the subbasis <m>\cS</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>13.5.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that
            <m>\cT' \in \cC</m> so that every <m>f_\a</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT'</m>.
            Now consider any subbasis element
            <m>S \in \cS</m> so that <m>S = \inv{f_\b}(U_\b)</m> for some
            <m>\b \in J</m> and some open set <m>U_\b</m> in <m>X_\b</m>.
            Then <m>f_\b</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT'</m> so that <m>S</m> is open with respect to <m>\cT'</m>,
            and hence <m>S \in \cT'</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cS \ss \cT'</m> since <m>S</m> was arbitrary,
            hence <m>\cT'</m> contains <m>\cS</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that <m>\cT'</m> is a topology on <m>A</m> that contains <m>\cS</m> so that <m>\cS \ss \cT'</m>.
            Consider any <m>\a \in J</m> and any open set <m>U_\a</m> of <m>X_\a</m>.
            Then clearly <m>\inv{f_\a}(U_\a)</m> is in <m>\cS_\a</m> so that it is also clearly in <m>\cS = \bigcup \cS_\b</m>.
            Hence also <m>\inv{f_\a}(U_\a) \in \cT'</m> since <m>\cS \ss \cT'</m>.
            Therefore <m>\inv{f_\a}(U_\a)</m> is open with respect to <m>\cT'</m>,
            which shows that <m>f_\a</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT'</m> since <m>U_\a</m> was an arbitrary open set of <m>X_\a</m>.
            Since <m>\a \in J</m> was also arbitrary,
            this shows that every <m>f_\a</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT'</m> so that <m>\cT' \in \cC</m> by definition.

        </proof>

        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that
            <m>g : Y \to A</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT</m>.
            Consider any <m>\a \in J</m> and any open set <m>U_\a</m> of <m>X_\a</m>.
            Then <m>\inv{f_\a}(U_\a)</m> is open with respect to <m>\cT</m> since <m>f_\a</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT</m> since every <m>f_\a</m> is.
            It then follows that <m>\inv{g}(\inv{f_\a}(U_\a))</m> is open in <m>Y</m> since <m>g</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT</m>.
            From Exercise<nbsp/>2.4 part<nbsp/>(a) we have that <m>\inv{g}(\inv{f_\a}(U_\a)) = \inv{(f_\a \circ g)}(U_\a)</m>,
            which shows that <m>f_\a \circ g</m> is continuous since <m>U_\a</m> was an arbitrary open set of <m>X_\a</m>.
            Since <m>\a \in J</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that every
            <m>f_\a \circ g</m> is continuous and consider any open set <m>U</m> of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>\cT</m>.
            Then by part<nbsp/>(b) we have that <m>U</m> is an arbitrary union of finite intersections of subbasis elements <m>\inv{f_\a}(U_\a)</m> for
            <m>\a \in J</m> and open <m>U_\a</m> in <m>X_\a</m>.
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>2.2 parts (b) and (c) that
            <m>\inv{g}(U)</m> is an arbitrary union of finite intersections of sets <m>\inv{g}(\inv{f_\a}(U_\a))</m>.
            Again we have that each <m>\inv{g}(\inv{f_\a}(U_\a)) = \inv{(f_\a \circ g)}(U_\a)</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>2.4 part<nbsp/>(a) so that each of these sets is open in <m>Y</m> since every <m>f_\a \circ g</m> is continuous.
            Hence <m>\inv{g}(U)</m> is open as well since it is the arbitrary union of finite intersections of these open sets and <m>Y</m> is a topological space.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary open set of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>\cT</m>,
            this shows that <m>g</m> is continuous relative to <m>\cT</m> as desired.

        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>U</m> is any open set of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>\cT</m>.
            Consider any <m>\vy = (y_\a)_{\a \in J} \in f(U)</m> so that there is an <m>a \in U</m> where <m>f(a) = \vy</m>.
            Since <m>a \in U</m> and <m>U</m> is open in <m>A</m>,
            we have that there is a basis element <m>B_A</m> containing <m>a</m> where <m>B_A \ss U</m>.
            It then follows from part<nbsp/>(b) that this basis element is a finite intersection of subbasis elements,
            hence <m>B_A = \bigcap_{\b \in I} \inv{f_\b}(U_\b)</m>,
            where <m>I \ss J</m> is finite and each <m>U_\b</m> is open in <m>X_\b</m>.
            Now define
            <md>
              <mrow>V_\a = \begin{cases}U_\b \amp  \a \in I \\ X_\b \amp  \a \notin I \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            so that clearly the set <m>B_p = \prod V_\a</m> is a basis element of
            <m>\prod X_\a</m> in the product topology by Theorem<nbsp/>19.1 since <m>I</m> is finite.
            We then have that <m>B_Z = Z \cap B_p</m> is a basis element of the subspace <m>Z</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>16.1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we have that <m>a \in U</m> and <m>U \ss A</m> so that <m>a \in A</m> as well.
            It then follows that <m>\vy = f(a) \in f(A) = Z</m>.
            For <m>\b \in I</m>, we also have that
            <m>a \in \inv{f_\b}(U_\b)</m> since the basis element <m>B_A = \bigcap_{\b \in I} \inv{f_\b}(U_\b)</m> contains <m>a</m>.
            Hence <m>f_\b(a) \in U_\b</m>.
            Since of course every other
            <m>f_\a(a) \in X_\a</m> when <m>\a \notin I</m>,
            we have that <m>f_\a(a) \in V_\a</m> for all
            <m>\a \in J</m> and thus <m>\vy = f(a) = (f_\a(a))_{\a \in J} \in \prod V_\a = B_p</m>.
            We therefore have that <m>\vy \in Z \cap B_p = B_Z</m> so that <m>B_Z</m> contains <m>\vy</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, consider any <m>\vz = (z_\a)_{\a \in J} \in B_Z = Z \cap B_p</m>.
            Then <m>\vz \in Z = f(A)</m> so that there is an <m>x \in A</m> where
            <m>f(x) = (f_\a(x))_{\a \in J} = \vz</m> and hence each <m>f_\a(x) = z_\a</m>.
            We also have that <m>\vz \in B_p = \prod V_\a</m> so that
            <m>z_\a \in V_\a</m> for every <m>\a \in J</m>.
            In particular <m>f_\b(x) = z_\b \in V_\b = U_\b</m> for all
            <m>\b \in I</m> so that <m>x \in \inv{f_\b}(U_\b)</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in \bigcap_{\b \in I} \inv{f_\b}(U_\b) = B_A</m> so that also <m>x \in U</m> since <m>B_A \ss U</m>.
            Then we have that <m>\vz = f(x) \in f(U)</m>.
            Since <m>\vz</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>B_Z \ss f(U)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have thus shown that <m>B_Z</m> is a basis element of the subspace <m>Z</m> that contains <m>\vy</m> where <m>B_Z \ss f(U)</m>.
            Since <m>\vy</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>f(U)</m>,
            this suffices to show that <m>f(U)</m> is open in the subspace <m>Z</m> as desired.

            for any <m>p \geq 1</m>, so assume it what follows that <m>x > 0</m>.
            We show this by induction on <m>p</m>.
            First, for <m>p=1</m> we clearly have that <m>x^p = x</m> and <m>y^p = y</m> so that of course the biconditional holds.

            Suppose that <m>x \lt  y</m> so that
            <m>x^p \lt  y^p</m> follows by the induction hypothesis.
            We also have that <m>y > 0</m> since

            Now suppose that it is not true that

            It then follows from the induction hypothesis that <m>x^p \geq y^p</m>.
            Then we have

            Hence by the contrapositive we have that

          Now we show that <m>d'</m> is a metric and induces the usual topology of <m>\reals^n</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            It is easy to see that <m>d'</m> meets the properties required of a metric.
            Clearly <m>d'(\vx, \vy) \geq 0</m> since each <m>\abs{x_i - y_i} \geq 0</m>,
            and <m>d'(\vx, \vy) = 0</m> if and only if each
            <m>x_i = y_i</m> so that <m>\vx = \vy</m>.
            Also it is obvious that <m>d'(\vx, \vy) = d'(\vy, \vx)</m> since each <m>\abs{x_i - y_i} = \abs{y_i - x_i}</m>.
            For the triangle inequality we simply have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d'(\vx, \vz) \amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - z_i}</mrow>

              <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{y_i - z_i}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = d'(\vx, \vy) + d'(\vy, \vz) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We now show that the metric topology induced by <m>d'</m> is the same as that induced by the square metric <m>\r</m>,
            which shows the desired result since the square metric induces the standard product topology on
            <m>\reals^n</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>20.3.
            First consider any <m>\vx \in \reals^n</m> and any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            Let <m>\d = \e</m> and consider any <m>\vy \in B_{d'}(\vx, \d)</m>.
            Suppose also that <m>j</m> is an index in <m>\intsfin{n}</m> where
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(\vx, \vy) = \max\braces{\abs{x_1 - y_1}, \ldots, \abs{x_n - y_n}} = \abs{x_j - y_j} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>\vy \in B_{d'}(\vx, \d)</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>d'(\vx,\vy) = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i} \lt  \d = \e</mrow>
              <mrow>\abs{x_j - y_j} + \sum_{i \neq j} \abs{x_i - y_i} \lt  \e</mrow>
              <mrow>\abs{x_j - y_j} \lt  \e - \sum_{i \neq j} \abs{x_i - y_i} \leq \e</mrow>
              <mrow>\r(\vx, \vy) \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            since of course <m>\sum_{i \neq j} \abs{x_i - y_i} \geq 0</m>.
            Therefore <m>\vy \in B_\r(\vx,\e)</m>,
            which shows <m>B_{d'}(\vx, \d) \ss B_\r(\vx, \e)</m> so that the metric topology of <m>d'</m> is finer the the metric topology of <m>\r</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>20.2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now again consider and <m>\vx \in \reals^n</m> and <m>\e > 0</m>,
            and this time let <m>\d = \e/n</m>.
            Consider any <m>\vy \in B_\r(\vx, \d)</m> and again suppose also that <m>j</m> is an index in <m>\intsfin{n}</m> where
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(\vx, \vy) = \max\braces{\abs{x_1 - y_1}, \ldots, \abs{x_n - y_n}} = \abs{x_j - y_j} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{x_j - y_j} = \r(\vx, \vy) \lt  \d = \e/n</mrow>

            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have
            <md>
              <mrow>d'(\vx, \vy) \amp = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_j - y_i} \amp  \text{(since each \(\abs{x_i - y_i} \leq \abs{x_j - y_j}\))}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = n \abs{x_j - y_j}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vy \in B_{d'}(\vx, \e)</m>.
            Hence <m>B_\r(\vx, \d) \ss B_{d'}(\vx, \e)</m> so that the metric topology of <m>\r</m> is also finer than that of <m>d'</m> again by Lemma<nbsp/>20.2.
            Therefore it must be that the two topologies are equal since each is finer than the other.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) Let <m>d</m> denote the metric defined in part<nbsp/>(a), that is

        <p>
          First we show that the metric topology induced by <m>d'</m> is finer than that induced by <m>\r</m>.
          So consider any <m>\vx \in \reals^n</m> and <m>\e > 0</m>.
          Let <m>\d = \e</m> and suppose that <m>\vy \in B_{d'}(\vx, \d)</m> so that
          <md>
            <mrow>d'(\vx, \vy) = \parens{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}^p}^{1/p} \lt  \d = \e \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>j</m> is an index in <m>\intsfin{n}</m> where
          <md>
            <mrow>\r(\vx, \vy) = \max\braces{\abs{x_1 - y_1}, \ldots, \abs{x_n - y_n}} = \abs{x_j - y_j} \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>\abs{x_j - y_j}^p \leq \abs{x_j - y_j}^p + \sum_{i \neq j} \abs{x_i - y_i}^p = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}^p</mrow>
          </md>
          so that, by <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref>, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>\parens{\abs{x_j - y_j}^p}^{1/p} \leq \parens{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}^p}^{1/p} \lt  \e</mrow>

            <mrow>\r(\vx, \vy) \lt  \e \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore <m>\vy \in B_\r(\vx, \e)</m> so that <m>B_{d'}(\vx, \d) \ss B_\r(\vx, \e)</m>.
          This suffices to show that the metric topology induced by <m>d'</m> is finer than that induced by <m>\r</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>20.2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we show that the metric topology induced by <m>d</m> is finer than that induced by <m>d'</m>.
          So again consider any <m>\vx \in \reals^n</m> and <m>\e > 0</m>.
          Again let <m>\d = \e</m> and suppose that <m>\vy \in B_d(\vx, \d)</m> so that
          <md>
            <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i} \lt  \d = \e \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, since each <m>\abs{x_i - y_i} \geq 0</m>,
          we have by <xref ref="lem_metric_polynom">Lemma</xref> that
          <md>
            <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}^p \amp \leq \parens{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}}^p</mrow>
            <mrow>\parens{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}^p }^{1/p} \amp \leq \squares{\parens{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i}}^p}^{1/p}</mrow>
            <mrow>d'(\vx, \vy) \amp \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i - y_i} \lt  \e \,</mrow>
          </md>,
          where we have used <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> in the second step.
          Thus <m>\vy \in B_{d'}(\vx, \e)</m> so that <m>B_d(\vx, \d) \ss B_{d'}(\vx, \e)</m>.
          This of course shows that the metric topology induced by <m>d</m> is finer than that induced by <m>d'</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>20.2 again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have shown that the metric topology induced by <m>d'</m> is finer than that induced by <m>\r</m>,
          and also that that induced by <m>d</m> is finer than that induced by <m>d'</m>.
          But it was shown in part<nbsp/>(a) and Theorem<nbsp/>20.3 that those induced by <m>d</m> and <m>\r</m> are the same topology,
          which is is the usual product topology on <m>\reals^n</m>.
          Hence if <m>\cT_p</m> denotes this usual product topology, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>\cT_p = \cT_\r \ss \cT_{d'} \ss \cT_d = \cT_\r = \cT_p \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>

            In what follows let
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(x,y) = \min\braces{\abs{x-y}, 1}</mrow>
            </md>
            be the standard bounded metric on <m>\reals</m>,
            noting that this is a metric by Theorem<nbsp/>20.1.
            Now define the function <m>d : \reals^2 \times \reals^2 \to \reals</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \begin{cases}1 \amp  x_1 \neq y_1 \\ \bd(x_2, y_2) \amp  x_1 = y_1 \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We claim that this is a metric on
            <m>\reals^2</m> that induces the dictionary order topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>d</m> is a metric on <m>\reals^2</m>.
            Clearly <m>d(\vx, \vy) \geq 0</m> since both <m>1 \geq 0</m> and
            <m>\bd(x_2, y_2) \geq 0</m> since <m>\bd</m> is a metric.
            Moreover if <m>\vx = \vy</m> then <m>x_1 = y_1</m> and
            <m>x_2 = y_2</m> so that <m>d(\vx, \vy) = \bd(x_2,y_2) = 0</m>.
            Conversely if <m>d(\vx, \vy) = 0</m> then clearly <m>d(\vx, \vy) \neq 1</m> so that it must be that
            <m>x_1 = y_1</m> and <m>d(\vx, \vy) = \bd(x_2,y_2) = 0</m> so that
            <m>x_2 = y_2</m> since <m>\bd</m> is a metric.
            From this it follows that <m>\vx = \vy</m> since
            <m>x_1 = y_1</m> and <m>x_2 = y_2</m>,
            which shows property (1) of a metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also obvious that <m>d(\vx, \vy) = d(\vy, \vx)</m> since if
            <m>x_1 \neq y_1</m> then <m>d(\vx,\vy) = 1 = d(\vy, \vx)</m>.
            If <m>x_1 = x_2</m> then <m>d(\vx, \vy) = \bd(x_2,y_2) = \bd(y_2,x_2) = d(\vy, \vx)</m> since <m>\bd</m> is a metric.
            This shows property (2) of a metric.
            Lastly, consider <m>\vx</m>, <m>\vy</m>,
            and <m>\vz</m> in <m>\reals^2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 \neq z_1</m>.
            Then <m>d(\vx, \vz) = 1</m> and it must be that either <m>y_1 \neq x_1</m> or
            <m>y_1 \neq z_1</m> since otherwise we would have that <m>x_1 = y_1 = z_1</m>.
            Thus either <m>d(\vx, \vy) = 1</m> or <m>d(\vy, \vz) = 1</m> and hence
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) + d(\vy, \vz) \geq 1 = d(\vx, \vz)</mrow>
            </md>
            since both <m>d(\vx, \vy) \geq 0</m> and <m>d(\vy, \vz) \geq 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 = z_1</m>.
            Then <m>d(\vx, \vz) = \bd(x_2,z_2)</m>.
            If <m>y_1 = x_1</m> then <m>x_1 = y_1 = z_1</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vz) = \bd(x_2,z_2) \leq \bd(x_2,y_2) + \bd(y_2,z_2) = d(\vx,\vy) + d(\vy,\vz)</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\bd</m> is a metric.
            If <m>y_1 \neq x_1</m> then <m>y_1 \neq x_1 = z_1</m>,
            and hence <m>d(\vx, \vy) = d(\vy, \vz) = 1</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vz) = \bd(x_2, z_2) \leq 1 \leq 2 = 1 + 1 = d(\vx, \vy) + d(\vy, \vz)</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\bd</m> is the bounded metric so that it is always at most 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in all cases we have shown property (3) of a metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            In what follows let <m>\prec</m> denote the dictionary order on <m>\reals^2</m>.
            To show that <m>d</m> induces the dictionary order topology,
            first consider any point <m>\vx \in \reals^2</m> and any basis element <m>B</m> of the dictionary order topology that contains <m>\vx</m>.
            Then of course <m>B = (\va, \vb)</m>,
            where <m>\va \prec \vx \prec \vb</m> since the dictionary order has no largest or smallest elements in <m>\reals^2</m>.
            Now define
            <md>
              <mrow>\d_a = \begin{cases}1 \amp  x_2 = a_2 \\ \abs{x_2 - a_2} \amp  x_2 \neq a_2 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            and
            <md>
              <mrow>\d_b = \begin{cases}1 \amp  x_2 = b_2 \\ \abs{x_2 - b_2} \amp  x_2 \neq b_2 \,, \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            and let <m>\d = \min\braces{1, \d_a, \d_b}</m>.
            Clearly the set <m>B_d(\vx, \d)</m> is a basis element of the topology induced by <m>d</m>,
            and we claim that <m>\vx \in B_d(\vx, \d) \ss B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            That <m>\vx \in B_d(\vx, \d)</m> is obvious.
            So now consider any <m>\vy \in B_d(\vx, \d)</m> so that <m>d(\vx, \vy) \lt \d \leq 1</m>.
            Hence it cannot be that <m>x_1 \neq y_1</m> by definition,
            since <m>d(\vx, \vy) = 1</m> in that case, and so <m>x_1 = y_1</m>.
            If <m>x_2 = a_2</m> then it has to be that
            <m>a_1 \lt x_1</m> since otherwise it would not be the case that <m>\va \prec \vx</m>.
            Thus we have <m>a_1 \lt x_1 = y_1</m> so that <m>\va \prec \vy</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand if <m>x_2 \neq a_2</m> then it must be that
            <m>a_1 \leq y_1</m> since otherwise we would have
            <m>x_1 = y_1 \lt a_1</m> so that <m>\vx \prec \va</m>.
            If <m>a_1 \lt y_1 = x_1</m> then of course
            <m>\va \prec \vy</m> so assume that <m>a_1 = y_1 = x_1</m>.
            The it must be that <m>a_2 \lt x_2</m> since <m>\va \prec \vx</m>,
            and so <m>\abs{x_2 - a_2} = x_2 - a_2</m>.
            Then, since <m>x_1 = y_1</m>,
            we have that <m>\bd(x_2, y_2) = d(\vx, \vy) \lt \d \leq 1</m> so it must be that <m>d(\vx, \vy) = \bd(x_2, y_2) = \abs{x_2 - y_2}</m>.
            Also <m>\d_a = \abs{x_2 - a_2} = x_2 - a_2</m> since <m>x_2 \neq a_2</m>.
            Hence we have <m>\abs{x_2 - y_2} = d(\vx, \vy) \lt \d \leq \d_a = x_2 - a_2</m>,
            from which it readily follows that
            <m>a_2 \lt y_2</m> so that again <m>\va \prec \vy</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore in all cases <m>\va \prec \vy</m>.
            Analogous arguments show that
            <m>\vy \prec \vb</m> so that <m>\vy \in (\va, \vb) = B</m>,
            which shows that <m>B_d(\vx, \d) \ss B</m> as desired since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that the topology induced by <m>d</m> is finer than the dictionary order topology by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now again suppose that <m>\vx \in \reals^2</m>,
            and that <m>\e'> 0</m> and <m>\vx' \in \reals^2</m> such that
            <m>B_d(\vx', \e')</m> is an arbitrary basis element of the metric topology induced by <m>d</m> that contains <m>\vx</m>.
            It was shown after the definition of a metric topology in the text that there is another ball
            <m>B_d(\vx, \e)</m> centered at <m>\vx</m> such that <m>B_d(\vx, \e) \ss B_d(\vx', \e')</m>.
            Let <m>\d = \min\braces{1, \e}</m> and define
            <m>\va = x_1 \times (x_2 - \d)</m> and <m>\vb = x_1 \times (x_2 + \d)</m>.
            Set <m>B = (\va, \vb)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of the dictionary order topology.
            So consider any <m>\vy \in B</m> so that <m>\va \prec \vy \prec \vb</m>.
            Clearly it must be that <m>a_1 = y_1 = b_1 = x_1</m> since otherwise we would have that
            <m>\vy \prec \va</m> or <m>\vb \prec \vy</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>a_2 = x_2 - \d \lt y_2 \lt x_2 + \d = b_2</m> so that
            <m>-\d \lt y_2 - x_2 \lt \d</m> and hence <m>\abs{x_2 - y_2} \lt \d</m>.
            Moreover, since <m>y_1 = x_1</m> and <m>\d \leq 1</m>,
            it follows that <m>d(\vx, \vy) = \bd(x_2, y_2) = \abs{x_2 - y_2} \lt \d \leq \e</m>.
            This shows that <m>\vy \in B_d(\vx, \e)</m>,
            which shows that <m>B \ss B_d(\vx, \e) \ss B_d(\vx', \e')</m> since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
            This proves that the dictionary order topology is finer than the topology induced by <m>d</m> again by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since each is finer than the other the topologies must be the same,
            which shows that the dictionary order topology is metrizable as desired.

          One can summarize the result of this exercise as follows: If <m>X</m> has a metric <m>d</m>,
          then the topology induced by <m>d</m> is the coarsest topology relative to which the function <m>d</m> is continuous.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          (a) We use Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(4) to show that <m>d</m> is continuous.
          So consider any <m>x_1 \times x_2 \in X \times X</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>z = d(x_1,x_2)</m>,
          noting that <m>V \ss \reals</m> since <m>\reals</m> is the range of <m>d</m>.
          Since <m>V</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>,
          there is a basis element <m>B = (a,b)</m> containing <m>z</m> where <m>B \ss V</m>.
          Hence <m>a \lt z \lt b</m>.
          Now let <m>\e = \min\braces{(z-a)/2, (b-z)/2}</m>,
          noting that <m>\e > 0</m> since <m>z > a</m> and <m>b > z</m>.
          Next define <m>U_1 = B_d(x_1, \e)</m> and
          <m>U_2 = B_d(x_2, \e)</m> so that they are both basis elements and therefore open sets of the metric space <m>X</m>.
          It then follows that <m>U = U_1 \times U_2</m> is a a basis element and therefore an open set of the product space <m>X \times X</m>.
          Clearly we have that <m>x_1 \in B_d(x_1, \e) = U_1</m> and
          <m>x_2 \in B_d(x_2, \e) = U_2</m> so that <m>U</m> contains
          <m>x_1 \times x_2</m> and so is a neighborhood of <m>x_1 \times x_2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>d(U) \ss B</m>.
          To see this, consider any <m>w \in d(U)</m> so that there is a
          <m>y_1 \times y_2 \in U = U_1 \times U_2</m> such that <m>w = d(y_1, y_2)</m>.
          Therefore <m>y_1 \in U_1 = B_d(x_1, \e)</m> so that <m>d(y_1, x_1) \lt  \e</m>,
          and similarly <m>d(y_2, x_2) \lt  \e</m> since <m>y_2 \in U_2 = B_d(x_2, \e)</m>.
          Then, since <m>d</m> is a metric, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>z = d(x_1, x_2) \amp \leq d(x_1, y_1) + d(y_1, x_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \leq d(x_1, y_1) + d(y_1, y_2) + d(y_2, x_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = d(y_1, x_1) + d(y_1, y_2) + d(y_2, x_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \lt  \e + w + \e</mrow>
            <mrow>z \amp \lt  w + 2\e \leq w + 2(z-a)/2 = w + z - a</mrow>
            <mrow>a \amp \lt  w \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>w = d(y_1, y_2) \amp \leq d(y_1, x_1) + d(x_1, y_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \leq d(y_1, x_1) + d(x_1, x_2) + d(x_2, y_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = d(y_1, x_1) + d(x_1, x_2) + d(y_2, x_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \lt  \e + z + \e</mrow>
            <mrow>w \amp \lt  z + 2\e \leq z + 2(b-z)/2 = z + b - z</mrow>
            <mrow>w \amp \lt  b \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We therefore have that <m>a \lt w \lt b</m> so that <m>w \in (a,b) = B</m>.
          This of course shows that <m>d(U) \ss B</m> since <m>w</m> was arbitrary.
          Moreover, we have that <m>B \ss V</m> so that clearly <m>d(U) \ss V</m>,
          which completes the proof of Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(4) so that <m>d</m> is continuous.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Let <m>U</m> be any open set of <m>X</m> and consider any <m>x \in U</m>.
          Then clearly there is a basis element <m>B_d(y, \e)</m>,
          for some <m>\e > 0</m> and <m>y \in U</m>,
          of the metric topology <m>X</m> that contains <m>x</m> and where <m>B_d(y, \e) \ss U</m>.
          Now, since <m>d</m> is continuous with respect to <m>X' \times X'</m>,
          it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>18.11 that the function
          <m>d_y(z) = d(y,z)</m> is a continuous function from <m>X'</m> to <m>\reals</m>.
          Since clearly the interval
          <m>(-\infty, \e)</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>,
          it then follows that the set
          <md>
            <mrow>\inv{d_y}((-\infty, \e)) = \braces{z \in X' \where d_y(z) \lt  \e} = \braces{z \in X \where d(y, z) \lt  \e} = B_d(y, \e)</mrow>
          </md>
          is also open in <m>X'</m>.
          Thus <m>B_d(y,\e)</m> is an open set in <m>X'</m> containing <m>x</m> such that <m>B_d(y, \e) \ss U</m>.
          This shows that <m>U</m> is also open in <m>X'</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>13.1 since the point <m>x \in U</m> was arbitrary.
          This suffices to show the desired result.

              If <m>U</m> is an open set of <m>X</m> containing a point <m>x</m> then there is a ball

        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            The main part of this proof was given after the definition of a metric topology in the text,
            but we repeat it here for completeness.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the definition of the metric topology,
            there is a <m>\d > 0</m> and <m>y \in X</m> such that the basis element
            <m>B_d(y,\d)</m> contains <m>x</m> and is contained in <m>U</m>.
            Let <m>\e = \d - d(x,y)</m> so that <m>d(x,y) = \d - \e</m>,
            noting that <m>\e > 0</m> since
            <m>x \in B_d(y, \d)</m> so that <m>d(x,y) \lt  \d</m>.
            Then, for any <m>z \in B_d(x, \e)</m>,
            we have that <m>d(z,x) \lt  \e</m> and so

              <mrow>d(z,y) \leq d(z,x) + d(x,y) = d(z,x) + \d - \e \lt  \e + \d - \e = \d</mrow>

            since <m>d</m> is a metric.
            Hence <m>z \in B_d(y, \d)</m> so that

        <lemma xml:id="lem_metric_finer">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>X</m> is a topological space and <m>Y</m> and <m>Y'</m> are topological spaces on the same set,
              and that <m>Y'</m> is finer than <m>Y</m>.
              Suppose also that <m>f: X \to Y</m> so that of course it is also a function from <m>X</m> to <m>Y'</m>.
              We assert the following: \begin{enumerate} \end{enumerate}
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For assertion (1) suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous with respect to <m>Y'</m> and let <m>U</m> be any open set of <m>Y</m>.
            Since <m>Y'</m> is finer than <m>Y</m>,
            it follows that <m>U</m> is also open in <m>Y'</m>.
            Then, since <m>f</m> is continuous with respect to <m>Y'</m> we have that <m>\inv{f}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>f</m> is continuous with respect to <m>Y</m> since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary open set.
            Assertion (2) follows immediately from the contrapositive of (1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding (3), suppose that a sequence
            <m>\seqinf{y}</m> converges to <m>y_0</m> in <m>Y'</m> and let <m>U</m> be any neighborhood of <m>y_0</m> in <m>Y</m>.
            Then <m>U</m> is also open in <m>Y'</m> since it is finer than <m>Y</m>,
            hence <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>y_0</m> in <m>Y'</m>.
            Thus there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> such that
            <m>x_n \in U</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>,
            since the sequence converges to <m>y_0</m> in <m>Y'</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>Y</m>,
            this shows that the sequence converges to <m>y_0</m> in <m>Y</m>.
            Assertion (4) follows immediately from the contrapositive of (3).
            Assertion (5) then immediately follows from (4) since,
            if a sequence does not converge at all in <m>Y</m> then for any point <m>y_0 \in Y</m>,
            it does not converge to <m>y_0</m>.
            Then it also does not converge to <m>y_0</m> in <m>Y'</m> by (4).
            Since <m>y_0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that it does not converge at all in <m>Y'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For (6), suppose that <m>Y</m> is a Hausdorff space and let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be distinct points of <m>Y'</m> so that they are of course also points of <m>Y</m>.
            Hence there are neighborhoods <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
            respectively, in <m>Y</m> that are disjoint.
            Since <m>Y'</m> is finer than <m>Y</m>,
            we have that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are also open sets of <m>Y'</m> and thus are disjoint neighborhoods of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>Y'</m> as well.
            This suffices to show that <m>Y'</m> is Hausdorff as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First, the functions <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>,
            and <m>h</m> can all be considered as special cases of the more general function
            <md>
              <mrow>s(t) = (s_n(t))_{n \in \pints} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where each <m>s_n(t) = \a_n t</m>,
            and <m>\a_n = n</m> for <m>f</m>,
            <m>\a_n = 1</m> for <m>g</m>,
            and <m>\a_n = 1/n</m> for <m>h</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly each <m>s_n</m> is continuous for the three <m>\a_n</m> by elementary calculus so that <m>s</m> is continuous in the product topology by Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 for all three <m>\a_n</m>.
            We can show that <m>s</m> is <em>not</em>
            continuous in the box topology for all three <m>\a_n</m> with a single example.
            Consider the set <m>B = \prod_{n \in \pints} (-1/n^2, 1/n^2)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of the box topology and so is open.
            Similar to Example<nbsp/>19.2, if <m>s</m> were continuous then there would be an interval
            <m>(-\d, \d)</m> about the point <m>0</m> such that <m>s((-\d, \d)) \ss B</m>,
            where of course <m>\d > 0</m>.
            This would of course mean that
            <md>
              <mrow>s_n((-\d, \d)) = (-\a_n \d, \a_n \d) \ss (-1/n^2, 1/n^2)</mrow>
            </md>
            for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            However, since clearly there is an <m>n \in \pints</m> large enough that
            <md>
              <mrow>n^3 \d \geq n^2 \d \geq n \d > 1 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>n\d \geq \d \geq \d/n > 1/n^2 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and hence for all three functions we have that <m>\a_n \d > 1/n^2</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>s_n((-\d,\d)) = (-\a_n\d, \a_n \d) \nss (-1/n^2, 1/n^2) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>s</m> cannot be continuous with respect to the box topology for all three <m>\a_n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that <m>f</m> is <em>not</em>
            continuous in the uniform topology.
            First, suppose that <m>\br</m> is the metric that induces the uniform topology, i.e.
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vx, \vy) = \sup\braces{\bd(x_n, y_n) \where n \in \pints} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider the basis element and open set
            <m>B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m> in the uniform topology.
            If <m>f</m> were continuous then there would be a <m>\d > 0</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>f((-\d, \d)) = \prod_{n \in \pints} (-\d n, \d n) \ss B_{\br}(\vze, 1) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly there is an <m>n \in \pints</m> large enough such that
            <m>n > 1/\d</m> so that <m>\d n > 1</m>.
            Then consider the point <m>\vx \in \reals^\w</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>x_m = \begin{cases}0 \amp  m \neq n+1 \\ \d n \amp  m = n+1 \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have of course that
            <m>-(n+1)\d \lt 0 \lt n\d = x_{n+1} \lt (n+1)\d</m> so that <m>x_{n+1} \in (-(n+1)\d, (n+1)\d)</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\vx \in f((-\d, \d)</m>.
            However, we also have that
            <m>\bd(\d n, 0) = \max\braces{\abs{\d n - 0}, 1} = \max\braces{\d n, 1} = 1</m> since <m>\d n > 1</m>.
            Hence it is not true that <m>\br(\vx, \vze) \lt 1</m> so that <m>\vx \notin B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m>.
            Thus <m>f((-\d, \d)) \nss B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m> so that <m>f</m> is not continuous in the uniform topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> <em>are</em>
            continuous in the uniform topology at the same time,
            which we show using Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(4).
            Consider any real <m>u</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>\vx = g(u)</m> (or
            <m>\vx = h(u)</m>) in the uniform topology.
            Then by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            there is an <m>\e > 0</m> such that the basis element
            <m>B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m> is a subset of <m>V</m>.
            Now consider the basis element and open set <m>U = B_d(u, \e/2)</m>,
            where <m>d</m> denotes the usual metric on <m>\reals</m>.
            Obviously <m>U</m> contains <m>u</m> but we also claim that
            <m>g(U) \ss V</m> (or <m>h(U) \ss V</m>),
            thereby completing the proof.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>\vy \in g(U)</m> (or
            <m>\vy \in h(U)</m>) so that there is some <m>v \in U</m> such that <m>\vy = g(v)</m> (or
            <m>\vy = h(v)</m>) In the case of <m>g</m> we have that <m>\vx = g(u) = (u,u,u,\ldots)</m>,
            which is to say that <m>x_n = u</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Similarly <m>y_n = v</m> for all
            <m>n \in \pints</m> since <m>\vy = g(v)</m>.
            Now, since <m>v \in U = B_d(u,\e/2)</m>, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(y_n, x_n) \leq d(y_n, x_n) = d(v, u) \lt  \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
            for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            From this it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vy, \vx) = \sup\braces{\bd(y_n, x_n) \where n \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise in the case of <m>h</m> we have that <m>x_n = u/n</m> and
            <m>y_n = v/n</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m> since
            <m>\vx = h(u)</m> and <m>\vy = h(v)</m>.
            We therefore have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(y_n, x_n) \leq d(y_n, x_n) = \abs{y_n - x_n} = \abs{v/n - u/n} = \abs{\frac{v-u}{n}} = \frac{1}{n}\abs{v-u} = \frac{1}{n}d(v,u) \lt  \frac{\e/2}{n} \leq \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
            for all <m>n \in \pints</m> since every <m>n \geq 1</m>.
            Hence again
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vy, \vx) = \sup\braces{\bd(y_n, x_n) \where n \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore for both functions we have
            <m>\br(\vy, \vx) \lt \e</m> so that <m>\vy \in B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m>.
            This shows that <m>g(U) \ss B_{\br}(\vx, \e) \ss V</m> (or
            <m>h(U) \ss B_{\br}(\vx, \e) \ss V</m>) as desired since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) First we note that, since <m>\reals</m> is a Hausdorff space,
          <m>\reals^\w</m> is as well in both the box and product topologies by Theorem<nbsp/>19.4.
          Therefore the uniform topology on
          <m>\reals^\w</m> is also Hausdorff by <xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref>
          part<nbsp/>(6) since it is finer than the product topology.
          It then follows from Theorem<nbsp/>17.10 that if any of the sequences converge in any of the three topologies,
          then they converge to a unique point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding whether the sequences converge in the various topologies then, we claim

        <proof>
          <p>
            Now, regarding the <m>\vw</m> sequence,
            each element in the sequence is defined as
            <md>
              <mrow>\vw_n = (w_{n,1}, w_{n,2}, w_{n,3}, \ldots) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where
            <md>
              <mrow>w_{n,m} = \begin{cases}0 \amp  m \lt  n \\ n \amp  m \geq n \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n,m \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that the <m>\vw</m> sequence converges to the point <m>\vze</m> in the product topology.
            So consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>\vze</m> in the product topology so that there is a basis element <m>B</m> containing <m>\vze</m> where <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Then <m>B = \prod_{m=1}^\infty B_m</m> where each <m>B_m</m> is open and <m>B_m</m> is all of <m>\reals</m> for all but finitely many values of <m>m</m>.
            Let <m>J</m> then be a finite subset of <m>\pints</m> where each
            <m>B_m = \reals</m> for <m>m \notin J</m>.
            Of course we also have that <m>0 \in B_m</m> for all
            <m>m \in \pints</m> since <m>B</m> contains <m>\vze</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then <m>J</m> has a largest element <m>N</m> since it is a finite set of positive integers.
            Now consider any <m>n \geq N+1</m> and any <m>m \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>m \in J</m> then we have that
            <m>m \leq N \lt N+1 \leq n</m> since <m>N</m> is the largest element of <m>J</m>,
            and hence <m>w_{n,m} = 0 \in B_m</m>.
            If <m>m \notin J</m> then of course <m>B_m = \reals</m> so that of course
            <m>w_{n,m} \in \reals = B_m</m> regardless of whether
            <m>w_{n,m} = 0</m> or <m>w_{n,m} = n</m>.
            Hence either way we have <m>w_{n,m} \in B_m</m>,
            which shows that <m>\vw_n \in \prod_{m=1}^\infty B_m = B</m> since <m>m</m> was arbitrary.
            Thus also <m>\vw_n \in U</m> since <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>n \geq N+1</m> was arbitrary and <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>\vze</m>,
            this shows that the sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that the <m>\vw</m> sequence does not converge in the uniform topology.
            It suffices to show that the sequence does not converge to <m>\vze</m>,
            since if it converged to any other point <m>\vx</m>,
            then by <xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref>
            part<nbsp/>(3) it would also converge to <m>\vx</m> in the product topology since it is coarser than the uniform topology.
            However, this would violate the fact that the sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> in the product topology
            (just shown above),
            and so cannot also converge to
            <m>\vx \neq \vze</m> since the convergence point is unique as noted above.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider the neighborhood
            <m>B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m> of <m>\vze</m> in the uniform topology.
            We claim that no elements of the sequence are in this neighborhood so that it clearly cannot converge to <m>\vze</m>.
            So consider any <m>n \in \pints</m> so that we clearly have <m>w_{n,n} = n \geq 1 > 0</m>.
            Therefore <m>d(w_{n,n}, 0) = \abs{w_{n,n} - 0} = \abs{w_{n,n}} = w_{n,n} \geq 1</m>,
            from which it follows that it has to be that <m>\bd(w_{n,n}, 0) = 1</m>.
            This of course implies that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vw_n, \vze) = \sup\braces{\bd(w_{n,m}, 0) \where m \in \pints} \geq 1 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence it is not true that <m>\br(\vw_n, \vze) \lt 1</m> so that <m>\vw_n \notin B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m>.
            This shows the desired result since <m>n</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows that the <m>\vw</m> sequence also does not converge at all in the box topology by <xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref>
            part<nbsp/>(5) since it is finer than the uniform topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the <m>\vx</m> sequence,
            the definition is that each
            <md>
              <mrow>\vx_n = (x_{n,1}, x_{n,2}, x_{n,3}, \ldots) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where
            <md>
              <mrow>x_{n,m} = \begin{cases}0 \amp  m \lt  n \\ 1/n \amp  m \geq n \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n,m \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that this sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> in the uniform topology,
            which is of course is the unique convergence point.
            So consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>\vze</m> in the uniform topology so that by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            there is an <m>\e > 0</m> where <m>B_{\br}(\vze, \e) \ss U</m>.
            Then there is a positive integer <m>N</m> large enough so that <m>N > 2/\e</m> so that,
            for any <m>n \geq N</m> we have <m>1/n \leq 1/N \lt  \e/2</m>.
            Next consider any such <m>n \geq N</m> and any <m>m \in \pints</m>.
            Since <m>x_{n,m}</m> is either <m>0</m> or <m>1/n</m> we have that <m>\abs{x_{n,m}} = x_{n,m} \leq 1/n</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(x_{n,m}, 0) \leq d(x_{n,m}, 0) = \abs{x_{n,m} - 0} = \abs{x_{n,m}} = x_{n,m} \leq 1/n \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, since <m>m</m> was arbitrary, it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vx_n, \vze) = \sup\braces{\bd(x_{n,m}, 0) \where m \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and hence <m>\vx_n \in B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m>.
            Thus also <m>\vx_n \in U</m> since <m>B_{\br}(\vze, \e) \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>n \geq N</m> was arbitrary as was the neighborhood <m>U</m>,
            this shows that the sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is coarser than the uniform topology,
            it follows that the <m>\vx</m> sequence also converges to <m>\vze</m> in the product topology as well by <xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref> part<nbsp/>(3).
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that the <m>\vx</m> sequence does not converge in the box topology,
            for which it suffices to show that it does not converge to <m>\vze</m>.
            Again, this is because,
            if it were to converge to some other point <m>\vy \neq 0</m> in the box topology,
            then it would also converge to <m>\vy</m> in the uniform topology since it is coarser (<xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref> part<nbsp/>(3)),
            but this would violate the fact that it converges to the unique point <m>\vze</m> by what was just shown.
            So consider the basis element and open set of the box topology
            <m>U = \prod_{n=1}^\infty U_n</m> where each <m>U_n = (-1/n, 1/n)</m>.
            Clearly <m>U</m> contains <m>\vze</m> so that it is a neighborhood of <m>\vze</m>.
            We claim that no element of the sequence is in <m>U</m>,
            which of course suffices to show that it cannot converge to <m>\vze</m>.
            So consider any <m>n \in \pints</m> and so that
            <m>x_{n,n} = 1/n \geq 1/n</m> so that <m>x_{n,n} \notin (-1/n, 1/n) = U_n</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>\vx_n \notin \prod_{n=1}^\infty U_n = U</m>.
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary this shows no element of the sequence is in <m>U</m> so that the sequence cannot converge to <m>\vze</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the <m>\vy</m> sequence, it is defined as
            <md>
              <mrow>\vy_n = (y_{n,1}, y_{n,2}, y_{n,3}, \ldots) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where
            <md>
              <mrow>y_{n,m} = \begin{cases}1/n \amp  m \leq n \\ 0 \amp  m > n \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n,m \in \pints</m>.
            Since <m>y_{n,m}</m> is always either <m>0</m> or <m>1/n</m>,
            the same argument that shows that the <m>\vx</m> sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> in the uniform topology shows that the <m>\vy</m> sequence does as well.
            Of course this also mean that it converges to <m>\vze</m> in the product topology as well since it is coarser.
            Similarly, the same argument that shows that the <m>\vx</m> sequence does not converge in the box topology applies to <m>\vy</m> as well since we have that
            <m>y_{n,n} = x_{n,n} = 1/n</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the <m>\vz</m> sequence is defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>\vz_n = (z_{n,1}, z_{n,2}, z_{n,3}, \ldots) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where
            <md>
              <mrow>z_{n,m} = \begin{cases}1/n \amp  m \leq 2 \\ 0 \amp  m > 2 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n,m \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show that this sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> in the box topology.
            So consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>\vze</m> in the box topology so that there is a basis element
            <m>B = \prod_{m=1}^\infty B_m</m> containing <m>\vze</m> where <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Of course then each <m>B_m</m> is open in <m>\reals</m> and <m>0 \in B_m</m>.
            Considering the standard topology of <m>\reals</m> using the metric topology basis,
            there is then an <m>\e_1 > 0</m> such that
            <m>B_d(0, \e_1) \ss B_1</m> by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            since <m>B_1</m> is open and contains <m>0</m>.
            Likewise there is an <m>\e_2 > 0</m> where <m>B_d(0, \e_2) \ss B_2</m>.
            So set <m>\e = \min\braces{\e_1, \e_2}</m> so that of course there is a positive integer <m>N</m> large enough that <m>N > 1/\e</m>.
            Then, for any <m>n \geq N</m> we have that
            <m>n \geq N > 1/\e</m> so that <m>1/n \lt  \e \leq \e_1</m>,
            and similarly <m>1/n \lt  \e \leq \e_2</m>.
            Now consider any <m>m \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>m \leq 2</m> then of course either <m>m = 1</m> or <m>m = 2</m> so that,
            either way, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(z_{n,m}, 0) = \abs{z_{n,m} - 0} = \abs{z_{n,m}} = \abs{1/n} = 1/n \lt  \e \leq \e_m</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>z_{n,m} \in B_d(0, \e_m) \ss B_m</m>.
            If <m>m > 2</m> then we clear have <m>z_{n,m} = 0 \in B_m</m> as well.
            Since <m>m</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\vz_n \in \prod_{m=1}^\infty B_m = B \ss U</m>.
            This shows that the sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> since
            <m>n \geq N</m> was arbitrary and <m>U</m> was any neighborhood of <m>\vze</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course this also shows that the <m>\vz</m> sequence converges to <m>\vze</m> in the uniform and product topologies as well by <xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref>
            part<nbsp/>(3) since they are both coarser than the box topology.

          Let <m>\rinf</m> be the subset of
          <m>\reals^\w</m> consisting of all sequences that are eventually zero.
          What is the closure of <m>\rinf</m> in

          Justify your answer.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>\reals^0</m> denote the subset of
          <m>\reals^\w</m> consisting of all sequences that converge to zero.
          We then claim that <m>\closure{\rinf} = \reals^0</m>,
          i.e. the closure of <m>\rinf</m> is <m>\reals^0</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> We show this by contrapositive.
            So suppose that <m>\vx \notin \reals^0</m> so that the sequence <m>\vx</m> does
            <em>not</em> converge to zero.
            Then there is a neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>0</m> in the standard topology on <m>\reals</m> such that,
            for any <m>N \in \pints</m>,
            there is an <m>n \geq N</m> where <m>x_n \notin V</m>.
            It also follows from <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            that there is an <m>\e > 0</m> such that <m>B_d(0, \e) \ss V</m>.
            So let <m>\d = \min\braces{\e, 1}</m> and consider the set <m>B_{\br}(\vx, \d)</m>,
            which is clearly a neighborhood of <m>\vx</m> in the uniform topology.
            Also suppose that <m>\vy</m> is any element of <m>\rinf</m> so that <m>\vy</m> is eventually zero.
            Then there must be an <m>N</m> where <m>y_n = 0</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
            From before we have that there is a specific <m>n \geq N</m> where
            <m>x_n \notin V</m> so that also <m>x_n \notin B_d(0, \e)</m>, and thus
            <md>
              <mrow>d(y_n, x_n) = d(0, x_n) = d(x_n, 0) \geq \e \geq \d \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we have that both <m>d(y_n, x_n) \geq \d</m> and <m>1 \geq \d</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(y_n, x_n) = \min\braces{d(y_n, x_n), 1} \geq \d \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this it clearly follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vy, \vx) = \sup\braces{\bd(y_n, x_n) \where n \in \pints} \geq \d</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vy \notin B_{\br}(\vx, \d)</m>.
            Since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>B_{\br}(\vx, \d)</m> does not intersect <m>\rinf</m>.
            This in turn shows that <m>\vx</m> is not a limit point of <m>\rinf</m>.
            Now, clearly also <m>\vx</m> cannot be eventually zero since then it would converge to zero,
            hence <m>\vx \notin \rinf</m> either.
            Therefore <m>\vx</m> cannot be in the closure of <m>\rinf</m>.
            Hence by the contrapositive we have that <m>\closure{\rinf} \ss \reals^0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now consider any
            <m>\vx \in \reals^0</m> so that the sequence <m>\vx</m> converges to zero.
            Consider any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>\vx</m> in the uniform topology so that,
            by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>,
            there is an <m>\e > 0</m> such that <m>B_{\br}(\vx, \e) \ss U</m>.
            Now, since <m>B_d(0, \e/2)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>0</m>,
            it follows that there is an
            <m>N \in \pints</m> where <m>x_n \in B_d(0, \e/2)</m> for all
            <m>n \geq N</m> since <m>\vx</m> converges to <m>0</m>.
            Now define the sequence <m>\vy</m> where
            <md>
              <mrow>y_n = \begin{cases}x_n \amp  n \lt  N \\ 0 \amp  n \geq N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly <m>\vy</m> is eventually zero so that <m>\vy \in \rinf</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also claim that <m>\vy \in U</m>.
            To see this consider any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>n \lt  N</m> then clearly <m>y_n = x_n</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(y_n, x_n) \leq d(y_n, x_n) = d(x_n, x_n) = 0 \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>n \geq N</m> then <m>y_n = 0</m> and we have from before that <m>x_n \in B_d(0, \e/2)</m> and hence
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(y_n, x_n) \leq d(y_n, x_n) = d(0, x_n) = d(x_n, 0) \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vy, \vx) = \sup\braces{\bd(y_n, x_n) \where n \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vy \in B_{\br}(\vx, \e) \ss U</m>.
            This shows that <m>\vy \in \rinf \cap U</m>.
            If <m>\vy = \vx</m> then of course <m>\vx = \vy \in \rinf</m> itself.
            If <m>\vy \neq \vx</m> then we have shown that <m>\vx</m> is a limit point of <m>\rinf</m> since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood.
            Thus either way <m>\vy \in \closure{\rinf}</m> so that
            <m>\closure{\rinf} \sps \reals^0</m> since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly, we note that <m>\rinf</m> is a proper subset of its closure <m>\closure{\rinf} = \reals^0</m> since,
          for example,
          the sequence <m>\vx</m> defined by <m>x_n = 1/n</m> for all
          <m>n \in \pints</m> clearly converges to zero so is in
          <m>\reals^0</m> but is not eventually zero so is not in <m>\rinf</m>.

            We show that <m>B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m> is not a subset of <m>U(\vx, \e)</m>,
            which of course suffices to show that they cannot be equal.
            To this end we define the point <m>\vy</m> in <m>\reals^\w</m> by

            for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Then, for any such <m>n</m>, we clearly have that

              <mrow>n \amp \geq 1</mrow>
              <mrow>-n \amp \leq -1 \lt  0</mrow>

            </md>
            so that <m>y_n \in (x_n - \e, x_n + \e)</m>.
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\vy \in \prod_{n=1}^\infty (x_n - \e, x_n + \e) = U(\vx, \e)</m>.
            However, again for any <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            it was shown that <m>x_n \leq y_n</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(y_n, x_n) = \abs{y_n - x_n} = y_n - x_n = x_n + \e\parens{1 - \frac{1}{n}} - x_n = \e\parens{1 - \frac{1}{n}} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was shown above that

            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then clearly have

            </md>
            since the sequence <m>\vy</m> is clearly monotonically increasing.
            This shows that <m>\vy \notin B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m> so that
            <m>B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m> cannot be a subset of <m>U(\vx, \e)</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\vy</m> be the point in
            <m>\reals^\w</m> defined in part<nbsp/>(a) so that we know that <m>\vy \in U(\vx, \e)</m>.
            Now if <m>U(\vx, \e)</m> were open in the uniform topology then there would be a basis element
            <m>B_{\br}(\vy, \d)</m> that is contained in <m>U(\vx, \e)</m>.
            We shall show that any such basis element cannot be contained within <m>U(\vx, \e)</m>,
            from which the desired result follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>\d > 0</m> so that there is an
            <m>n \in \pints</m> large enough that <m>n > \e/\d</m>.
            Then we have

          <p>
            Now define the point <m>\vz</m> by

              <mrow>z_m = \begin{cases}y_m \amp  m \neq n \\ \frac{(x_n + \e) + (y_n + \d)}{2} \amp  m = n \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows that <m>x_n + \e \lt  z_n \lt  y_n + \d</m>.
            The fact that <m>x_n + \e \lt  z_n</m> means that of course
            <m>z_n \notin (x_n - \e, x_n + \e)</m> so that <m>\vz \notin \prod_{m=1}^\infty (x_m - \e, x_m + \e) = U(\vx, \e)</m>.
            However, for <m>m \neq n</m> we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(z_m, y_m) = d(y_m, y_m) = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            and so <m>\bd(z_m, y_m) = 0</m> as well.
            For <m>m = n</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x_m + \e = x_n + \e \lt  z_m = z_n \lt  y_n + \d = y_m + \d</mrow>
              <mrow>x_m + \e - y_m \lt  z_m - y_m \lt  \d</mrow>
              <mrow>x_m + \e - x_m - \e\parens{1 - \frac{1}{n}} \lt  z_m - y_m \lt  \d</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \lt  \e\frac{1}{n} \lt  z_m - y_m \lt  \d</mrow>
              <mrow>\abs{z_m - y_m} \lt  \d</mrow>
              <mrow>\bd(z_m, y_m) \leq d(z_m, y_m) \lt  \d \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From these facts it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vz, \vy) = \sup_{m \in \pints} \bd(z_m, y_m) = \bd(z_n, y_n) \lt  \d</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vz \in B_{\br}(\vy, \d)</m>.
            This shows that <m>B_{\br}(\vy, \d)</m> is not a subset of <m>U(\vx, \e)</m>,
            which shows the desired result as explained before.

            Then there is a <m>\d</m> where
            <m>\br(\vy, \vx) \lt  \d \lt  \e</m> since the reals are order-dense.
            For any <m>n \in \pints</m> it must be that
            <m>\bd(y_n, x_n) \lt  \d \lt  \e \lt  1</m> since <m>\br</m> is the supremum of these.
            From this it has to be that <m>\bd(y_n, x_n) = d(y_n, x_n) \lt  \d</m> so that

          <p>
            Hence <m>y_n \in (x_n - \d, x_n + \d)</m>.
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\vy \in \prod_{n=1}^\infty (x_n-\d, x_n+\d) = U(\vx, \d)</m>.
            Thus obviously <m>\vy \in \bigcup_{\d \lt \e} U(\vx, \d)</m>,
            which shows the desired result.

        <p>
          Consider the map <m>h: \reals^\w \to \reals^\w</m> defined in Exercise<nbsp/>8 of <m>\S 19</m>;
          give <m>\reals^\w</m> the uniform topology.
          Under what conditions on the numbers <m>a_i</m> and <m>b_i</m> is <m>h</m> continuous? a homeomorphism?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First some discussion.
          We know that the product topology is strictly finer than the uniform topology in <m>\reals^\w</m>,
          and the that box topology is strictly finer than the uniform topology.
          By <xref ref="lem_metric_finer">Lemma</xref> part<nbsp/>(1),
          when the topology on the range of a function becomes coarser,
          the function remains continuous.
          It is similarly easy to show that if the topology on the <em>domain</em>
          of a function becomes <em>finer</em>,
          it also remains continuous.
          However, nothing can be said for sure if the range becomes finer and/or the domain becomes coarser.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>19.8 that <m>h</m> is a homeomorphism
          (for <m>a_i > 0</m> as in the exercise)
          if both the domain and range have the product topology,
          or if they both have the box topology.
          By what was just discussed then,
          <m>h</m> is at least continuous with box topology on the domain,
          and the uniform topology on the range,
          or likewise with the uniform topology on the domain and the product topology on the range.
          However, the relative
          <q>fineness</q>
          of these topologies does not allow us to conclude anything about whether <m>h</m> is continuous or a homeomorphism when both the domain and range are the uniform topologies,
          which is unfortunately what we are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, we claim that <m>h</m> is continuous with the uniform topology as the domain and range if and only if the set of numbers <m>\braces{a_i}_{i \in \pints}</m> is bounded
          (and of course each <m>a_i > 0</m>).

            <m>(\imp)</m> We show this direction by contrapositive.
            So suppose that <m>\braces{a_i}</m> is not bounded.
            We then show that <m>h</m> is not continuous by showing the negation of Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(4).
            So consider the point <m>\vze</m> and the neighborhood
            <m>V = B_{\br}(h(\vze), 1)</m> in the uniform topology.
            Consider also any neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>\vze</m> so that by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            there is an <m>\e > 0</m> where <m>B_{\br}(\vze, \e) \ss U</m>.
            Now define the point <m>\vx \in \reals^\w</m> by
            <m>x_i = \e/2</m> for all <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then, for any <m>i \in \pints</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(x_i, 0) \leq d(x_i, 0) = \abs{x_i - 0} = \abs{x_i} = \abs{\e/2} = \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
            so that clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vx, \vze) = \sup\braces{\bd(x_i, 0) \where i \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e \,</mrow>

            and hence <m>\vx \in B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m> so that also <m>\vx \in U</m>.
            Then clearly <m>h(\vx) \in h(U)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, since the <m>a_i</m> coefficients are unbounded,
            there is a specific <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            where <m>a_i \geq 2/\e</m> regardless of how small <m>\e</m> is.
            We then have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(h_i(x_i), h_i(0)) = d(a_i x_i + b_i, b_i) = \abs{a_i x_i + b_i - b_i} = \abs{a_i x_i} = a_i \abs{x_i} = a_i \frac{\e}{2} \geq \frac{2}{\e} \frac{\e}{2} = 1 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            from which we have <m>\bd(h_i(x_i), h_i(0)) = 1</m> and so
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(h(\vx), h(\vze)) = \sup\braces{\bd(h_i(x_i), h_i(0)) \where i \in \pints} \geq 1 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then of course <m>h(\vx) \notin B_{\br}(h(\vze), 1) = V</m>.
            This shows that <m>h(U) \nss V</m>,
            which in turn shows that <m>h</m> is not continuous,
            since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>\vze</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that the coefficients <m>a_i</m> are bounded so that there is a real <m>a</m> where
            <m>0 \lt a_i \leq a</m> for all <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Consider any <m>\vx \in \reals^\w</m> and any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>h(\vx)</m> in the uniform topology.
            Then there is an <m>\e > 0</m> where
            <m>B_{\br}(h(\vx), \e) \ss V</m> by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>.
            So let <m>\d = \min\braces{\e/2a, 1}</m>,
            noting that <m>\d > 0</m> since both <m>\e > 0</m> and <m>a > 0</m>.
            Then <m>U = B_{\br}(\vx, \d)</m> is of course a neighborhood of <m>\vx</m> in the uniform topology.
            We claim that <m>h(U) \ss V</m>.

            To see this,
            suppose that <m>\vz \in h(U)</m> so that there is a

            Then <m>\br(\vy, \vx) \lt  \d \leq 1</m> since <m>\vy \in U</m>,
            from which it follows that each <m>\bd(y_i, x_i) \lt  \d \leq 1</m>,

            We then have that

            </md>
            for each <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            From this it follows that

            so that <m>\vz \in B_{\br}(h(\vx), \e) \ss V</m>.
            Since <m>\vz</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f(U) \ss V</m>,
            which shows that <m>h</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(4) since <m>V</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood.

          The function <m>h</m> is a homeomorphism if and only if there are real
          <m>a,
          a_0 > 0</m> where <m>0 \lt a_0 \leq a_i \leq a</m> for all <m>i \in \pints</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it was just shown that <m>h</m> is continuous if and only if <m>\braces{a_i}</m> is bounded above.
            It was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>19.8 that <m>h</m> is bijective
            (so long as each <m>a_i > 0</m>)
            and that its inverse function <m>\inv{h}</m> has the same form as <m>h</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow>\inv{h}(\vy) = (c_i y_i + d_i)_{i \in \pints} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where each <m>c_i = 1/a_i</m> and <m>d_i = -b_i/a_i</m>.
            Since the topologies of the domain and range of <m>\inv{h}</m> are both the uniform topology,
            as with <m>h</m>,
            it follows that the same conditions on <m>c_i</m> and <m>d_i</m> will make <m>\inv{h}</m> continuous.
            That is to say that <m>\inv{h}</m> is continuous
            (and thus <m>h</m> is a homeomorphism)
            if and only if also <m>\braces{c_i} = \braces{1/a_i}</m> is bounded above.
            Of course <m>\braces{1/a_i}</m> being bounded above means that
            <m>\braces{a_i}</m> cannot get arbitrarily close to zero and so must have some nonzero lower bound <m>a_0</m>.

            So let <m>N = \max\braces{N_a, N_b}</m> and consider any <m>n \geq N</m>.
            Then <m>n \geq N \geq N_a</m> so that <m>\abs{a_n - a} \lt  \e</m> and hence

            Together these show that the sequence of partial series is non-increasing.
            Also, since the series of partial sums is non-decreasing,
            we have that that the infinite sum cannot be less than any of the partial sums, that is
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i \geq \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i</mrow>

            To show that the sequence of partial series converges to zero,
            consider any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            We know that the sequence of partial sums converges to the infinite sum by the definition of a series.
            Hence there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i} \amp \lt  \e</mrow>

            for all <m>n \geq N</m>,
            and hence <m>\abs{p_n - 0} \lt  \e</m> for all <m>n \geq N+1</m>.
            This of course shows convergence to zero as desired.

            First we show that the $\ell^2$-topology is finer than the topology inherited from the uniform topology using Lemma<nbsp/>20.2 since they are both metric topologies.
            So consider any <m>\vx \in X</m> and let
            <m>B = X \cap B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m> for any <m>\e > 0</m>,
            which is of course a basis element of the subspace topology inherited by the uniform topology.
            Then the set <m>C = B_d(\vx, \e/2)</m>
            (where <m>d</m> is the metric defined above for the $\ell^2$-topology instead of the usual metric on <m>\reals</m>)
            is a basis element of the $\ell^2$-topology.
            We claim that <m>\vx \in C \ss B</m>,
            which completes the proof that the $\ell^2$-topology is finer.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it is obvious that <m>\vx \in C</m>.
            Now consider any <m>\vy \in C = B_d(\vx, \e/2)</m>.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vy, \vx) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2}^{1/2} \lt  \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            For <m>n \in \pints</m> let
            <md>
              <mrow>s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i)^2</mrow>
            </md>
            be the partial sums of the infinite sum <m>\sum (y_i-x_i)^2</m>.
            Clearly each term in the sum is non-negative so that the sequence of partial sums is non-decreasing.
            It then follows that <m>s_n \leq \sum (y_i-x_i)^2</m> for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            We clearly then have, for any <m>n \in \pints</m>, that
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{y_n-x_n}^2 = (y_n-x_n)^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (y_i-x_i)^2  + (y_n-x_n)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-x_i)^2 = s_n \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i-x_i)^2</mrow>
            </md>
            since again each term is non-negative.
            Hence by <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{y_n-x_n} = \squares{\abs{y_n-x_n}^2}^{1/2} \leq \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i-x_i)^2}^{1/2} \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\bar{p}(y_n,x_n) \leq p(y_n,x_n) = \abs{y_n-x_n} \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where we have let <m>p</m> and <m>\bar{p}</m> denote the standard metric and standard bounded metric,
            respectively, on <m>\reals</m>.
            Since this is true for any <m>n \in \pints</m>, it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vy, \vx) = \sup\braces{\bar{p}(y_n,x_n) \where n \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vy \in B_{\br}(\vx, \e)</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>\vy \in X \cap B_{\br}(\vx, \e) = B</m> so that <m>C \ss B</m> as desired since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that the topology inherited from the box topology is finer the $\ell^2$-topology using Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            So consider any <m>\vx \in X</m> and any basis element <m>B</m> containing <m>\vx</m> of the $\ell^2$-topology.
            Then by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            there is an <m>\e > 0</m> where
            <m>B_d(\vx,\e) \ss B</m> since <m>B</m> is of course open.
            Now consider the set
            <md>
              <mrow>C = X \cap \prod_{i \in \pints} B_p(x_i, \e/\sqrt{2^{i+1}}) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where again <m>p</m> denotes the usual metric on <m>\reals</m>.
            Then clearly <m>C</m> is a basis element of the subspace topology inherited by the box topology and contains <m>\vx</m>,
            noting that clearly each <m>\e/\sqrt{2^{i+1}} > 0</m>.
            We claim that <m>C \ss B_d(\vx, \e) \ss B</m>,
            which shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see this suppose that <m>\vy \in C</m> so that
            <m>\vy \in X</m> and <m>\vy \in \prod B_p(x_i, \e/\sqrt{2^{i+1}})</m>.
            Then, for any <m>i \in \pints</m>, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>p(y_i, x_i) = \abs{y_i - x_i} \leq \e/\sqrt{2^{i+1}}</mrow>
            </md>
            is true.
            It then follows from <xref ref="lem_metric_pmon">Lemma</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>(y_i - x_i)^2 = \abs{y_i - x_i}^2 \leq \parens{\e/\sqrt{2^{i+1}}}^2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.

          <p>
            Since this is true for any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            we have by <xref ref="cor_metric_sumleq">Corollary</xref> that

              <mrow>\amp = \frac{\e^2}{2}</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\sum (1/2)^i</m> is a geometric series.
            It then follows from <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vy, \vx) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2}^{1/2} \leq \parens{\frac{\e^2}{2}}^{1/2} = \frac{\e}{\sqrt{2}} \lt  \e</mrow>

            so that <m>\vy \in B_d(\vx, \e)</m>.
            Since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>C \ss B_d(\vx, \e) \ss B</m> as desired,

            Since relative topological
            <q>fineness</q>
            is preserved when inherited by subspace topologies
            (which is trivial to show),
            we have from part<nbsp/>(a) and what was shown in the text that
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{ box topology }  \sps \text{\elltop{}}  \sps \text{ uniform topology }  \sps \text{ product topology }</mrow>
            </md>
            on <m>\rinf</m>.
            To show that they are all distinct,
            it then suffices to show that each of the box,
            <m>\ell^2</m>, and uniform topologies
            (or more properly the subspace topologies inherited from them)
            have open sets that are not open in the <m>\ell^2</m>, uniform,
            and product topologies, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that the inherited box topology has an open set that is not open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology.
            Consider the set <m>U = \rinf \cap \prod_{n \in \pints} (-1, 1/n)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element and open set in the inherited box topology.
            We show that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology using the contrapositive of <xref ref="cor_metric_subball">Corollary</xref>.
            So consider the point <m>\vze</m>,
            which is clearly contained in <m>U</m> and any <m>\e > 0</m> and the arbitrary ball <m>B_d(\vze, \e)</m> of <m>X</m>.
            Of course, there is positive integer <m>N</m> large enough that <m>N \geq 2/\e</m>,
            and hence <m>1/N \leq \e/2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, consider the sequence <m>\vx</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>x_n = \begin{cases}0 \amp  n \neq N \\ \e/2 \amp  n = N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly <m>\vx</m> is eventually zero so that
            <m>\vx \in \rinf</m> since <m>x_n = 0</m> for all <m>n \geq N+1</m>.
            We also clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vze) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - 0)^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\parens{\frac{\e}{2}}^2}^{1/2} = \frac{\e}{2} \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vx \in B_d(\vze, \e)</m>.
            Therefore <m>\vx \in \rinf \cap B_d(\vze, \e)</m>.
            However, we have that <m>1/N \leq \e/2 = x_N</m> so that <m>x_N \notin (-1, 1/N)</m>,
            and hence <m>\vx \notin \prod_{n \in \pints} (-1, 1/n)</m>.
            From this clearly <m>\vx \notin U</m> so that
            <m>\rinf \cap B_d(\vze, \e)</m> cannot be a subset of <m>U</m>.
            Since the ball <m>B_d(\vze, \e)</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that there is an open set in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology that is not open in the inherited uniform topology.
            So consider the set <m>U = \rinf \cap B_d(\vze, 1)</m>,
            which is clearly open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology.
            We show that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited uniform topology,
            again by the contrapositive of <xref ref="cor_metric_subball">Corollary</xref>.
            Consider the point <m>\vze</m>, clearly in <m>U</m>,
            and any <m>\e > 0</m> so that
            <m>B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m> is an arbitrary ball in the uniform topology on <m>\reals^\w</m>.
            Now clearly there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> large enough that <m>N \geq (2/\e)^2</m>.
            It then follows from <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref>
            that <m>\sqrt{N} \geq 2/\e</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now define the sequence <m>\vx</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>x_n = \begin{cases}\e/2 \amp  n \leq N \\ 0 \amp  n > N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>, so that clearly <m>\vx \in \rinf</m>.
            Then clearly we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\bar{p}(x_n, 0) \leq p(x_n, 0) = \abs{\e/2 - 0} = \abs{\e/2} = \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>n \leq N</m>,
            where again <m>p</m> and <m>\bar{p}</m> are the standard and standard bounded metrics on <m>\reals</m>,
            respectively.
            If <m>n > N</m> clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>\bar{p}(x_n, 0) \leq p(x_n, 0) = \abs{0 - 0} = \abs{0} = 0 \leq \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vx, \vze) = \sup\braces{\bar{p}(x_n, 0) \where n \in \pints} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vx \in B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m>.
            Therefore of course <m>\vx \in \rinf \cap B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m>.
            However, we also have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, 0) \amp = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - 0)^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^N \parens{\frac{\e}{2}}^2}^{1/2}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \squares{N \parens{\frac{\e}{2}}^2}^{1/2} = \sqrt{N}\frac{\e}{2}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \geq \frac{2}{\e}\parens{\frac{\e}{2}} = 1</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\sqrt{N} \geq 2/\e</m>.
            Therefore clearly <m>\vx \notin B_d(\vze, 1)</m> so that <m>\vx \notin U</m>.
            It follows that <m>\rinf \cap B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m> cannot be a subset of <m>U</m>.
            Since <m>B_{\br}(\vze, \e)</m> was an arbitrary ball,
            this shows that <m>U</m> is not open in the uniform topology as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly we show that there is an open set in the inherited uniform topology that is not open in the inherited product topology.
            So let <m>U = \rinf \cap B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m>,
            which is clearly open in the inherited uniform topology.
            We show that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited product topology using the definition of a basis.
            Consider any basis element <m>B</m> of the inherited product topology that contains <m>\vze</m> so that <m>B = \rinf \cap \prod_{n \in \pints} B_n</m>,
            where each <m>B_n</m> is open in <m>\reals</m> and
            <m>B_n \neq \reals</m> for only finitely many <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Then clearly there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where <m>B_N = \reals</m>,
            and clearly we have <m>0 \in B_n</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So define the sequence <m>\vx</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>x_n = \begin{cases}0 \amp  n \neq N \\ 1 \amp  n = N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly <m>\vx \in \rinf</m> since <m>x_n = 0</m> for all <m>n \geq N+1</m>.
            For any <m>n \in \pints</m> we have that <m>x_n = 0 \in B_n</m> if <m>n \neq N</m>,
            and <m>x_n = 1 \in \reals = B_n</m> for <m>n = N</m>.
            Hence clearly <m>\vx \in \prod B_n</m> so that <m>\vx \in \rinf \cap \prod B_n = B</m> as well.
            However, we clearly have that
            <md>
              <mrow>p(x_N,0) = \abs{x_N - 0} = \abs{1 - 0} = \abs{1} = 1 \geq 1</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\bar{p}(x_N, 0) = \min\braces{p(x_N,0), 1} = 1 \geq 1</m>.
            Then it has to be that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(\vx, \vze) = \sup\braces{\bar{p}(x_n, 0) \where n \in \pints} \geq 1</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vx \notin B_{\br}(\vze, 1)</m> and hence <m>\vx \notin U</m>.
            This shows that <m>B</m> is not a subset of <m>U</m>,
            which shows that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited product topology since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary basis element.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c) First, we note that <m>H</m> is contained in <m>X</m> by the comparison test since the series <m>\sum (1/n)^2</m> converges.
          Then, again since relative topological
          <q>fineness</q>
          is preserved when inherited by subspace topologies, we know that
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ box topology }  \sps \text{\elltop{}}  \sps \text{ uniform topology }  \sps \text{ product topology }</mrow>
          </md>
          on <m>H</m>.
          We claim, however,
          that the inherited box topology is distinct from the other three,
          which are all the same.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that the inherited box topology has an open set that is not open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology,
            in a very similar way to how this was shown in part<nbsp/>(b).
            Consider the set <m>U = H \cap \prod_{n \in \pints} (-1, 1/n)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element and open set in the inherited box topology.
            We show that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology using the contrapositive of <xref ref="cor_metric_subball">Corollary</xref>.
            So consider the point <m>\vze</m>,
            which is clearly contained in <m>U</m> and any <m>\e > 0</m> and the arbitrary ball <m>B_d(\vze, \e)</m> of <m>X</m>.
            Of course, there is positive integer <m>N</m> large enough that <m>N \geq 2/\e</m>,
            and hence <m>1/N \leq \e/2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, consider the sequence <m>\vx</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>x_n = \begin{cases}0 \amp  n \neq N \\ 1/N \amp  n = N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly <m>\vx \in H</m> since each <m>x_n \in [0,1/n]</m>.
            We also clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vze) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - 0)^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2}^{1/2} = \squares{x_N^2}^{1/2} = x_N = 1/N \leq \e/2 \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vx \in B_d(\vze, \e)</m>.
            Therefore <m>\vx \in H \cap B_d(\vze, \e)</m>.
            However, we have that <m>x_N = 1/N</m> so that <m>x_N \notin (-1, 1/N)</m>,
            and hence <m>\vx \notin \prod_{n \in \pints} (-1, 1/n)</m>.
            From this clearly <m>\vx \notin U</m> so that
            <m>H \cap B_d(\vze, \e)</m> cannot be a subset of <m>U</m>.
            Since the ball <m>B_d(\vze, \e)</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>U</m> is not open in the inherited $\ell^2$-topology as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that the other three topologies are the same on <m>H</m>,
            it suffices to show that the inherited product topology is finer than the inherited $\ell^2$-topology,
            which we do using Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            So consider any <m>\vx \in H</m> and any basis element <m>B</m> of the inherited $\ell^2$-topology that contains <m>\vx</m>.
            It then follows from <xref ref="cor_metric_subball">Corollary</xref>
            that there is an <m>\e > 0</m> where
            <m>B' = H \cap B_d(\vx, \e) \ss B</m> since of course <m>B</m> is open.
            Now, by <xref ref="lem_metric_pseries">Lemma</xref>
            the sequence of partial series <m>p_n = \sum_{i=n}^\infty (1/i)^2</m> converges to zero so that there is an
            <m>N \in \pints</m> where <m>p_n = \abs{p_n} = \abs{p_n - 0} \lt  \e^2/2</m> for all
            <m>n \geq N</m> since each <m>p_n</m> is non-negative
            (also by <xref ref="lem_metric_pseries">Lemma</xref>).
            In particular <m>p_{N+1} = \sum_{i=N+1}^\infty (1/i)^2 \lt  \e^2/2</m>.
            So define the following sets:
            <md>
              <mrow>C_n = \begin{cases}B_p(x_n, \e/\sqrt{2N}) \amp  n \leq N \\ \reals \amp  n > 0 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            where again <m>p</m> is the usual metric on <m>\reals</m>.
            Clearly <m>C = H \cap \prod C_n</m> is a basis element in the inherited product topology that contains <m>\vx</m>.
            We now claim that <m>C \ss B' \ss B</m>,
            which shows that the inherited product topology is finer by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary basis element.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see this, consider any <m>\vy \in C</m> so that
            <m>\vy \in H</m> and <m>\vy \in \prod C_n</m>.
            Now, for any <m>n \leq N</m>,
            we have that <m>y_n \in C_n = B_p(x_n, \e/\sqrt{2N})</m> so that <m>\abs{y_n - x_n} \lt  \e/\sqrt{2N}</m>.
            It then follows from <xref ref="lem_metric_pmon">Lemma</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>(y_n - x_n)^2 = \abs{y_n - x_n}^2 \lt  \parens{\frac{\e}{\sqrt{2N}}}^2 = \frac{\e^2}{2N} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this is true of each
            <m>n \leq N</m>, we clearly have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - x_i)^2 \lt  \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\e^2}{2N} = N\frac{\e^2}{2N} = \frac{\e^2}{2} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, for any <m>n > N</m> we have that of course that
            <m>\vy \in H = \prod [0, 1/n]</m> so that <m>y_n \in [0, 1/n]</m>.
            Similarly <m>\vx \in H</m> so that <m>x_n \in [0,1/n]</m>.
            Then both <m>0 \leq y_n \leq 1/n</m> and <m>0 \leq x_n \leq 1/n</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>0 \leq x_n \leq 1/n</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \geq -x_n \geq -1/n</mrow>
              <mrow>y_n \geq y_n - x_n \geq y_n - 1/n</mrow>
              <mrow>1/n \geq y_n \geq y_n - x_n \geq y_n - 1/n \geq 0 - 1/n = -1/n \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence <m>\abs{y_n - x_n} \leq 1/n</m>,
            from which it follows that
            <m>(y_n-x_n)^2 = \abs{y_n-x_n}^2 \leq (1/n)^2</m> by <xref ref="lem_metric_pmon">Lemma</xref>.
            Since this it true for any <m>n > N</m>,
            it follow from either <xref ref="lem_metric_seqleq">Lemma</xref>
            or <xref ref="cor_metric_sumleq">Corollary</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=N+1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2 \leq \sum_{i=N+1}^\infty \parens{\frac{1}{i}}^2 \lt  \frac{\e^2}{2} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have, from the definition of partial series
            (<xref ref="def_metric_pseries">Definition</xref>),
            that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - x_i)^2 + \sum_{i=N+1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2 \lt  \frac{\e^2}{2} + \frac{\e^2}{2} = \e^2</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Then <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> means that

              <mrow>d(\vy, \vx) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2}^{1/2} \lt  \parens{\e^2}^{1/2} = \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\vy \in B_d(\vx, \e)</m>,
            and hence clearly <m>\vy \in H \cap B_d(\vx, \e) = B'</m>.
            Since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary,

          First we show some basic properties of these operations that will be useful:
        </p>
        <lemma xml:id="lem_metric_vprops">
          <statement>
            <p>
              For any <m>\vx, \vy \in \reals^n</m> and <m>a \in \reals</m>,
              we assert the following: \begin{enumerate} \end{enumerate}
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For assertion (1) clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>\vx \cdot \vy= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i x_i = \vy \cdot \vx</mrow>
            </md>
            by the definition of the dot product.
            Regarding (2), we clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>\vze \cdot \vx = \sum_{i=1}^n 0 \cdot x_i = \sum_{i=1}^n 0 = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For (3) first suppose that
            <m>\vx \neq \vze</m> so that that there is an <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> where
            <m>x_k \neq 0</m> so that clearly <m>x_k^2 > 0</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\norm{\vx} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = \sum_{i=k} x_i^2 + \sum_{i \neq k} x_i^2 = x_k^2 + \sum_{i \neq k} x_i^2 \geq x_k^2 + 0 = x_k^2 > 0</mrow>
            </md>
            since each term in the sum
            <m>\sum_{i \neq k} x_i^2</m> is non-negative so that the overall sum is as well.
            Thus of course <m>\norm{\vx} \neq 0</m>.
            This shows the forward implication by contrapositive.
            For the reverse direction, suppose that <m>\vx = \vze</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\norm{\vx} = \norm{\vze} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^n 0^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^n 0}^{1/2} = \squares{0}^{1/2} = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assertion (4) is fairly obvious from the definition.
            Clearly each <m>x_i^2 \geq 0</m> since it is a square,
            so that <m>\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \geq 0</m> as well.
            It then follows from <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> that

              <mrow>\norm{\vx} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}^{1/2} \geq 0^{1/2} = 0</mrow>

            as desired.
            Assertion (5) is also easy to show:

              <mrow>\vx \cdot \vx = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = \parens{\squares{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}^{1/2}}^2 = \norm{\vx}^2</mrow>

            So in what follows assume that <m>\vx, \vy \neq \vze</m>.
            Then by <xref ref="lem_metric_vprops">Lemma</xref>
            part<nbsp/>(3) we have that <m>\norm{\vx}</m> and
            <m>\norm{\vy}</m> are both nonzero so that
            <m>a = 1/\norm{\vx}</m> and <m>b = 1/\norm{\vy}</m> are defined.
            Then, by <xref ref="lem_metric_vprops">Lemma</xref>
            part<nbsp/>(4), we of course have
            <md>
              <mrow>\norm{a\vx \pm b\vy} \geq 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.

          <p>
            Since clearly

              <mrow>a\vx \pm b\vy = (ax_1 \pm by_1, \ldots, ax_n \pm by_n)</mrow>
            </md>
            by the definition of the operations, we have

              <mrow>\squares{\sum_{i=1}^n (ax_i \pm by_i)^2}^{1/2} = \norm{a\vx \pm b\vy} \geq 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows from <xref ref="lem_metric_pmon">Lemma</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^n (ax_i \pm by_i)^2 \geq 0^2 = 0</mrow>

              <mrow>\pm 2ab (\vx \cdot \vy) \geq -a^2 \norm{\vx}^2 - b^2 \norm{\vy}^2</mrow>
              <mrow>\pm 2\frac{\vx \cdot \vy}{\norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}} \geq -\frac{\norm{\vx}^2}{\norm{\vx}^2} - \frac{\norm{\vy}^2}{\norm{\vy}^2}</mrow>
              <mrow>\pm 2\frac{\vx \cdot \vy}{\norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}} \geq -1 - 1</mrow>

            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence we have that both <m>\vx \cdot \vy \leq \norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</m> and
            <m>- \vx \cdot \vy \leq \norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</m> so that <m>\vx \cdot \vy \geq -\norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</m>.
            Hence

            so we can conclude that <m>\abs{\vx \cdot \vy} \leq \norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</m> as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First recall that the euclidean metric on <m>\reals^n</m> is defined as
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \norm{\vx - \vy} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then part<nbsp/>(1) of the definition of a metric follows directly from <xref ref="lem_metric_vprops">Lemma</xref> since of course
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \norm{\vx - \vy} \geq 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have that <m>\vx = \vy</m> if and only if <m>\vx - \vy = 0</m>,
            which is true if and only if
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \norm{\vx - \vy} = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            by <xref ref="lem_metric_vprops">Lemma</xref> part<nbsp/>(3).
            Similarly part<nbsp/>(2) of the definition follows from <xref ref="lem_metric_vprops">Lemma</xref> part<nbsp/>(6) as follows:
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \norm{\vx - \vy} = \norm{(-1)(\vy - \vx)} = \abs{-1}\norm{\vy - \vx} = \norm{\vy - \vx} = d(\vy, \vx) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, for part<nbsp/>(3) of the definition, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vz) \amp = \norm{\vx - \vy} = \norm{\vx - \vz + \vy - \vy} = \norm{(\vx - \vy) + (\vy - \vz)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \leq \norm{\vx - \vy} + \norm{\vx - \vz} = d(\vx, \vy) + d(\vy, \vz) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where we have used what was shown in part<nbsp/>(c).
            This shows that <m>d</m> has all the properties required to be a metric.

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, denote the partial sums of the series <m>\sum \abs{x_i y_i}</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i y_i}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly then each term in the sum is non-negative so that the sequence of partial sums is non-decreasing,
            which is to say that <m>s_{n+1} \geq s_n</m> for every <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Then, to show that the series converges,
            it suffices to show that the partial sums are bounded,
            since convergence then follows from what will be shown in Exercise<nbsp/>21.11 part<nbsp/>(a).
            To this end we show that the sequence <m>\seqinf{s}</m> is a bounded above.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, first let us define the real numbers
            <md>
              <mrow>\norm{\vx} \amp = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2}^{1/2} \amp \norm{\vy} \amp = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty y_i^2}^{1/2} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which we know are well defined since <m>\vx, \vy \in X</m>.
            Also, for any <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            define the truncated sequences
            <m>\vx_n = \seqfin{x}{n}</m> and <m>\vy_n = \seqfin{y}{n}</m>.
            We know from <xref ref="lem_metric_pseries">Lemma</xref>
            that the partial series <m>\sum_{i=n}^\infty x_i^2</m> and
            <m>\sum_{i=n}^\infty y_i^2</m> are non-negative for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            From this and <xref ref="def_metric_pseries">Definition</xref> we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty x_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            It then follows from <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>\norm{\vx_n} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}^{1/2} \leq \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2}^{1/2} = \norm{\vx} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and similarly <m>\norm{\vy_n} \leq \norm{\vy}</m> for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Hence, clearly <m>\norm{\vx_n} \norm{\vy_n} \leq \norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</m> since norms are always non-negative by <xref ref="lem_metric_vprops">Lemma</xref> part<nbsp/>(4).
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, we define <m>\vxb_n = (\abs{x_1}, \ldots, \abs{x_n})</m> and
            <m>\vyb_n = (\abs{y_1}, \ldots, \abs{y_n})</m> for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            From this definition it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\norm{\vxb_n} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i}^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}^{1/2} = \norm{\vx_n} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and similarly that <m>\norm{\vyb_n} = \norm{\vy_n}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Putting all of this together we have by Exercise<nbsp/>20.9 part<nbsp/>(b) that
            <md>
              <mrow>s_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i y_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i} \abs{y_i} = \vxb_n \cdot \vyb_n \leq \norm{\vxb_n} \norm{\vyb_n} = \norm{\vx_n} \norm{\vy_n} \leq \norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            This shows that the sequence of partial sums is bounded by <m>\norm{\vx} \norm{\vy}</m>,
            which shows the desired result as previously discussed.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it is a well known fact that if a series converges absolutely,
            then it converges.
            Hence, since it was shown in part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>\sum \abs{x_i y_i}</m> converges,
            we have that <m>\sum x_i y_i</m> also converges.
            We of course also know that <m>\sum x_i^2</m> and
            <m>\sum y_i^2</m> converge since <m>\vx, \vy \in X</m>.
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>21.11 part<nbsp/>(b) that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i + y_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i^2 + 2x_i y_i + y_i^2)</mrow>
            </md>
            converges to <m>\sum x_i^2 + 2 \sum x_i y_i + \sum y_i^2</m>.
            Since of course
            <md>
              <mrow>\vx + \vy = (x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \ldots)</mrow>
            </md>
            we have that <m>\vx + \vy \in X</m> as desired.
            We also have that <m>c \vx = \seqinf{cx}</m> by definition,
            and it again follows from Exercise<nbsp/>21.11 part<nbsp/>(b) that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty (c x_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^\infty c^2 x_i^2</mrow>
            </md>
            converges to <m>c^2 \sum x_i^2</m>.
            Hence <m>c\vx \in X</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>\vx,\vy \in X</m>.
            It then follows from part<nbsp/>(b) that <m>-\vy = (-1) \vy \in X</m>.
            Then also <m>\vx - \vy = \vx + (-\vy) \in X</m> as well,
            again by what was shown in part<nbsp/>(b).
            Since we clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>\vx - \vy = (x_1 - y_1, x_2 - y_2, \ldots) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            it therefore follows that <m>\sum (x_i - y_i)^2</m> converges since <m>\vx - \vy \in X</m>.
            Hence the function
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2}^{1/2}</mrow>
            </md>
            is well defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>d</m> is a metric,
            first it is obvious that <m>d(\vx, \vy) \geq 0</m> for all
            <m>\vx, \vy \in X</m> since each term is non-negative so that the sequence of partial sums is non-negative and non-decreasing.
            Also, clearly if <m>\vy = \vx</m> then
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = d(\vx, \vx) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - x_i)^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty 0^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty 0}^{1/2} = 0^{1/2} = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show the converse,
            suppose that <m>\vx \neq \vy</m> so that there is an
            <m>n \in \pints</m> where <m>x_n \neq y_n</m>,
            and hence <m>x_n - y_n \neq 0</m> and <m>(x_n - y_n)^2 > 0</m>.
            Referencing <xref ref="def_metric_pseries">Definition</xref>,
            we then have
            <md>
              <mrow>0 \amp \lt  (x_n - y_n)^2 = \sum_{i=n}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i - y_i)^2 + \sum_{i=n}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 + \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 + \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus by <xref ref="cor_metric_opmon">Corollary</xref> we have

            so that of course <m>d(\vx, \vy) \neq 0</m> as desired.
            This shows part<nbsp/>(1) of the definition of a metric.

              <mrow>d(\vx, \vy) = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2}^{1/2} = \squares{\sum_{i=1}^\infty (y_i - x_i)^2}^{1/2} = d(\vy, \vx) \,</mrow>

            For part<nbsp/>(3) consider any <m>\vx,\vy,\vz \in X</m>.
            Denote the truncated sequences by

            and similarly for <m>\vy_n</m> and <m>\vz_n</m>.
            Then we have

              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty (x_i - y_i)^2 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \norm{\vx_n - \vy_n}^2 \,</mrow>

            Since the function <m>f(x) = x^{1/2}</m> is continuous on the domain

            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>21.3 in the next section that

            Since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> are arbitrary,

              <mrow>\norm{\vx_n - \vz_n} \leq \norm{\vx_n - \vy_n} + \norm{\vy_n - \vz_n}</mrow>

            Note that we have used the well known property of sequences that,

            then <m>\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) = a + b</m>.
            (This is shown later in Exercise<nbsp/>21.5.)
            This shows that <m>d</m> has all three of the properties required to be a metric.

        </hint>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>d'</m> is a valid metric.
            Since <m>d</m> is a metric, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(x,y) \geq 0</mrow>
              <mrow>1 + d(x,y) \geq 1 > 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence clearly <m>d'(x,y) = d(x,y)/(1+d(x,y)) \geq 0</m> as well.
            If <m>x = y</m> then <m>d(x,y) = 0</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>d'(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1 + d(x,y)} = \frac{0}{1 + 0} = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, if <m>d'(x,y) = 0</m> then it has to be that
            <m>d(x,y) = 0</m> as well since <m>1 + d(x,y) > 0</m>.
            It then must be that <m>x = y</m> since <m>d</m> is a metric.
            This shows part<nbsp/>(1) of the definition of a metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            part<nbsp/>(2) is easy to show:
            <md>
              <mrow>d'(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1 + d(x,y)} = \frac{d(y,x)}{1 + d(y,x)} = d'(y,x)</mrow>
            </md>
            since again <m>d</m> is a metric so that <m>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For part<nbsp/>(3) define the function <m>f(x) = x/(1+x)</m> over the domain
            <m>\braces{x \in \reals \where x \geq 0}</m> so that clearly <m>d'(x,y) = f(d(x,y))</m>.
            We first show that <m>f</m> is monotonically increasing.
            The easiest way to do this is to show that its derivative is always positive,
            from which monotonicity follows from elementary calculus.
            Using the quotient rule, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>f'(x) = \frac{1 \cdot (1+x) - x \cdot 1}{(1+x)^2} = \frac{1 + x - x}{(1+x)^2} = \frac{1}{(1+x)^2} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly we have <m>x \geq 0</m> so that <m>1 + x \geq 1 > 0</m>,
            and hence <m>(1+x)^2 > 0^2 = 0</m> by <xref ref="lem_metric_pmon">Lemma</xref>.
            It then follows that <m>f'(x) = 1/(1+x)^2 > 0</m>,
            and thus <m>f</m> is monotonically increasing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, for any <m>a,b \geq 0</m> we clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>1 + a \leq 1 + a + b + b + ab + b^2</mrow>
              <mrow>1 + a \leq 1 \cdot (1 + a + b) + b(1 + a + b)</mrow>
              <mrow>1 + a \leq (1 + a + b)(1 + b)</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{1}{(1 + a + b)(1 + b)} \leq \frac{1}{1 + a}</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>1+a \geq 0</m> and
            <m>1 + a + b</m> and <m>1 + b</m> are both non-negative so that their product is as well.
            It then follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>f(a+b) - f(b) \amp = \frac{a+b}{1+a+b} - \frac{b}{1+b} = \frac{(a+b)(1+b) - b(1+a+b)}{(1+a+b)(1+b)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \frac{a+ab+b+b^2-b-ab-b^2}{(1+a+b)(1+b)} = \frac{a}{(1+a+b)(1+b)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \leq \frac{a}{1+a} = f(a)</mrow>
            </md>
            by what was just shown before since <m>a \geq 0</m>.
            Hence we have <m>f(a+b) \leq f(a) + f(b)</m>.
            Since <m>d</m> is a metric, we then of course have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(x,z) \amp \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)</mrow>
              <mrow>f(d(x,z)) \amp \leq f(d(x,y) + d(y,z)) \amp  \text{ (since \(f\) is monotonically increasing) }</mrow>
              <mrow>f(d(x,z)) \amp \leq f(d(x,y) + d(y,z))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \leq f(d(x,y)) + f(d(y,z)) \amp  \text{ (by what was just shown) }</mrow>
              <mrow>d'(x,z) \amp \leq d'(x,y) + d'(y,z) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            for any <m>x,y,z \in X</m>,
            which of course shows part<nbsp/>(3) of the definition.
            This completes the proof that <m>d'</m> is a valid metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to see that <m>d'</m> is bounded by <m>1</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow>0 \lt  1</mrow>
              <mrow>d(x,y) \lt  1 + d(x,y)</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{d(x,y)}{1 + d(x,y)} \lt  1</mrow>
              <mrow>d'(x,y) \lt  1</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>d'</m> is a bounded metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we must show that the metric topologies induced by <m>d</m> and <m>d'</m> are the same.
            First we show that the topology induced by <m>d</m> is finer than that induced by <m>d'</m> using Lemma<nbsp/>20.2.
            So consider any <m>x \in X</m> and any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            If <m>\e \geq 1</m> set <m>\d = 999</m>,
            otherwise set <m>\d = \e/(1-\e)</m> noting that in this case <m>\e \lt  1</m> so that
            <m>0 \lt  1-\e</m> and hence <m>\d > 0</m>.
            Now consider any <m>y \in B_d(x, \d)</m> so that <m>d(y,x) \lt  \d</m>.
            If <m>\e \geq 1</m> then of course
            <m>d'(y,x) \lt  1 \leq \e</m> since we have previously shown the <m>d'</m> is bounded by <m>1</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>\e \lt  1</m>, then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(y,x) \lt  \d = \frac{\e}{1-\e}</mrow>
              <mrow>d(y,x)(1 - \e) \lt  \e</mrow>
              <mrow>d(y,x) - \e d(y,x) \lt  \e</mrow>
              <mrow>d(y,x) \lt  \e + \e d(y,x) = \e (1 + d(y,x))</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{d(y,x)}{1 + d(y,x)} \lt  \e</mrow>
              <mrow>d'(x,y) \lt  \e \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus either was we have <m>d'(y,x) \lt \e</m> so that <m>y \in B_{d'}(x, \e)</m>,
            which of course shows that
            <m>B_d(x,\d) \ss B_{d'}(x,\e)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Since <m>\e</m> was arbitrary this shows the desired result that the topology induced by <m>d</m> is finer than that induced by <m>d'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show the other direction,
            i.e. that the <m>d'</m> topology is also finer than the <m>d</m> topology,
            again using Lemma<nbsp/>20.2.
            So consider any <m>x \in X</m> and <m>\e > 0</m> again.
            This time set <m>\d = \e / (1+\e)</m> noting that <m>\d > 0</m> follows trivially from the fact that <m>\e > 0</m>.
            Then, for any <m>y \in B_{d'}(x, \d)</m>, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>d'(y,x) \lt  \d = \frac{\e}{1+\e}</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{d(y,x)}{1 + d(y,x)} \lt  \frac{\e}{1+\e}</mrow>
              <mrow>d(y,x)(1 + \e) \lt  \e (1 + d(y,x))</mrow>
              <mrow>d(y,x) + \e d(y,x) \lt  \e + \e d(y,x)</mrow>
              <mrow>d(y,x) \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>y \in B_d(x, \e)</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>B_{d'}(x, \d) \ss B_d(x, \e)</m>,
            which in turn shows that the <m>d'</m> topology is finer than the <m>d</m> topology as desired.
            Since each topology is finer than the other,
            of course they must be the same as desired.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A \ss X</m>.
          If <m>d</m> is a metric for the topology of <m>X</m>,
          show that <m>d \rest A \times A</m> is a metric for the subspace topology on <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let us denote the restricted function <m>d \rest A \times A</m> by <m>d'</m>.
            Clearly <m>d'</m> is a metric on <m>A</m>,
            since for <m>x,y \in A</m> we have
            <m>d'(x,y) = d(x,y)</m> and <m>d</m> has all the properties of a metric.
            We show that the metric topology induced by <m>d'</m> is the same as the subspace topology using Lemma<nbsp/>13.3 in both directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>B_{d'}(x,\e) = A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m> for any <m>x \in A</m> and <m>\e > 0</m>.
            For any <m>y \in B_{d'}(x,\e)</m> we have that clearly <m>y \in A</m> since the metric <m>d'(y,x)</m> must be defined,
            and <m>d(y,x) = d'(y,x) \lt \e</m> so that also <m>y \in B_d(x,\e)</m>.
            Thus <m>y \in A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m>,
            and hence <m>B_{d'}(x,\e) \ss A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m>.
            For the other direction suppose that
            <m>y \in A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m> so that <m>y \in A</m> and <m>y \in B_d(x,\e)</m>.
            Thus <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>A</m> so that <m>d'(y,x)</m> is defined and <m>d'(y,x) = d(y,x) \lt \e</m>,
            and hence <m>y \in B_{d'}(x,\e)</m>.
            This shows that <m>B_{d'}(x,\e) \sps A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m>,
            which in turn shows that the two sets are the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, clearly each basis element of the metric topology
            <m>B_{d'}(x,\e) = A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m> is also a basis element of the subspace topology by Lemma<nbsp/>16.1.
            Hence for any <m>x \in A</m> we have that
            <m>B_m = B_{d'}(x,\e)</m> is a basis element of the metric topology and
            <m>B_s = A \cap B_d(x,\e)</m> is a basis element of the subspace topology.
            But <m>B_m = B_s</m> so that <m>x \in B_s \ss B_m</m> and
            <m>x \in B_m \ss B_s</m> so that each topology is finer than the other by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            Thus they are the same topologies.

          First, let <m>Z = f(X)</m> and let <m>f'</m> denote the function <m>f</m> with the range restricted to <m>Z</m> so that clearly <m>f'</m> is surjective.
          First we must show that <m>f</m> and therefore also <m>f'</m> is injective,
          from which it clearly follows that <m>f'</m> is a bijection.
          So suppose that <m>x_1,x_2 \in X</m> where <m>f(x_1) = f(x_2)</m>.
          Then we have that
          <md>
            <mrow>d_X(x_1, x_2) = d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_1)) = 0</mrow>
          </md>
          by property (1) of the metric <m>d_Y</m>,
          so that it must be that <m>x_1 = x_2</m> since <m>d_X</m> is a metric and <m>d_X(x_1, x_2) = 0</m>.
          This of course means that <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> are injective and hence <m>f'</m> is bijective.
        </p>
        <p>
          We show that <m>f'</m> and <m>\ivfp</m> are both continuous using Theorem<nbsp/>21.1 since <m>X</m> and <m>Z</m> are both metric spaces,
          noting that <m>Z \ss Y</m> is a metric space with metric
          <m>d_Z = d_Y \rest Z \times Z</m> by the previous exercise.
          So consider any <m>x \in X</m> and any <m>\e > 0</m>, and let <m>\d = \e</m>.
          Then for any <m>x_1,x_2 \in X</m> where <m>d_X(x_1,x_2) \lt  \d</m> we have
          <md>
            <mrow>d_Z(f'(x_1), f'(x_2)) = d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) = d_X(x_1,x_2) \lt  \d = \e \,</mrow>
          </md>,
          which suffices to show that <m>f'</m> is continuous.
          A similar argument shows that <m>\ivfp: Z \to X</m> is continuous.
          For <m>y_1,y_2 \in Z</m> and <m>\e > 0</m>,
          again let <m>\d = \e</m> and suppose that <m>d_Z(y_1,y_2) \lt \d</m>.
          Let <m>x_1 = \ivfp(y_1)</m> and <m>x_2 = \ivfp(y_2)</m>.
          Then we have
          <md>
            <mrow>d_X(\ivfp(y_1), \ivfp(y_2)) \amp = d_X(x_1, x_2) = d_Y(f(x_1),  f(x_2)) = d_Y(f'(x_1), f'(x_2))</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = d_Y(f'(\ivfp(y_1)), f'(\ivfp(y_2))) = d_Y(y_1, y_2)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = d_Z(y_1, y_2) \lt  \d = \e \,</mrow>
          </md>,
          which of course shows that <m>\ivfp</m> is also continuous.
          This shows that <m>f'</m> is a homeomorphism so that <m>f</m> is an imbedding as desired.

        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            The proofs of both parts are quite simple.
            Regarding part<nbsp/>(1) we have that
            <m>x_\b \leq y_\b \leq \sup\braces{y_\a}</m> for any <m>\b \in J</m> so that clearly
            <m>\sup\braces{y_\a}</m> is an upper bound of the set <m>\braces{x_\a}</m>.
            It then follows by the definition of the supremum as the least upper bound that <m>\sup\braces{x_\a} \leq \sup\braces{y_\a}</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            For part<nbsp/>(2) consider any <m>\b \in J</m>.
            Clearly <m>x_\b \leq \sup\braces{x_\a}</m> and <m>y_\b \leq \sup\braces{y_\a}</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>x_\b + y_\b \leq \sup\braces{x_\a} + \sup\braces{y_\a} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>\b</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\sup\braces{x_\a} + \sup\braces{y_\a}</m> is an upper bound for the set <m>\braces{x_\a + y_\a}</m>.
            Therefore <m>\sup\braces{x_\a + y_\a} \leq \sup\braces{x_\a} + \sup\braces{y_\a}</m> as desired by the definition of the supremum as the least upper bound.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First we must show that <m>\r</m> is a metric at all.
            In what follows suppose that
            <m>x,y,z \in \cpfin{X}{n}</m> and that <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> are elements of <m>\intsfin{n}</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(x,y) = \max\braces{d_1(x_1,y_1), \ldots, d_n(x_n, y_n)} = d_k(x_k, y_k)</mrow>
            </md>
            and
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(x,z) = \max\braces{d_1(x_1,z_1), \ldots, d_n(x_n, z_n)} = d_m(x_m, z_m) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we have <m>\r(x,y) = d_k(x_k, y_k) \geq 0</m> since <m>d_k</m> is a metric.
            If <m>x = y</m> then of course
            <m>x_k = y_k</m> so that <m>\r(x,y) = d_k(x_k, y_k) = 0</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>\r(x,y) = 0</m> and consider any <m>l \in \intsfin{n}</m>.
            Then we have that <m>d_l(x_l, y_l) \geq 0</m> and that <m>d_l(x_l, y_l) \leq \r(x,y) = 0</m>,
            and hence it must be that <m>d_l(x_l, y_l) = 0</m> so that
            <m>x_l = y_l</m> since <m>d_l</m> is a metric.
            Since <m>l</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>x = y</m>,
            which shows that <m>\r</m> satisfies part<nbsp/>(1) of the definition of a metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            As usual, part<nbsp/>(2) of the definition is the easiest to show since
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(x,y) \amp = \max\braces{d_1(x_1,y_1), \ldots, d_n(x_n, y_n)} =</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \max\braces{d_1(y_1,x_1), \ldots, d_n(y_n, x_n)} =</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \r(y,x) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            as we have that each <m>d_l(x_l, y_l) = d_l(y_l, x_l)</m> since <m>d_l</m> is a metric.
            Lastly, for part<nbsp/>(3) we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(x,z) = d_m(x_m, z_m) \leq d_m(x_m, y_m) + d_m(y_m, z_m) \leq \r(x,y) + \r(y,z)</mrow>
            </md>
            since of course <m>d_m</m> is a metric.
            This completes the proof that <m>\r</m> is a proper metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that both topologies are the same using Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            So suppose that <m>x \in \cpfin{X}{n}</m> and
            <m>B_\r(x,\e)</m> is any basis element of the metric topology and let <m>B = \prod_{i=1}^n B_{d_i}(x_i, \e)</m>,
            which is clearly a basis element of the product topology that contains <m>x</m> since each
            <m>B_{d_i}(x_i, \e)</m> is open in the metric space <m>X_i</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>y \in B</m> so that each <m>y_i \in B_{d_i}(x_i, \e)</m>.
            So, for every <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>,
            we have <m>d_i(y_i, x_i) \lt  \e</m> so that clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(y,x) = \max\braces{d_1(y_1,x_1), \ldots, d_n(y_n, x_n)} \lt  \e \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>y \in B_\r(x,\e)</m>.
            This shows that <m>x \in B \ss B_\r(x,\e)</m> so that
            <m>B_\r(x,\e)</m> the product topology is finer than the metric topology by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider again any <m>x \in \cpfin{X}{n}</m> and any basis element
            <m>B = \prod_{i=1}^n U_i</m> of the product topology.
            Then of course each <m>U_i</m> is open in <m>X_i</m> and
            <m>x_i \in U_i</m> so that there is a ball <m>B_{d_i}(x_i, \e_i)</m> such that
            <m>B_{d_i}(x_i, \e_i) \ss U_i</m> by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>.
            Let <m>\e = \min\braces{\e_1, \ldots, \e_n}</m> and consider the basis element
            <m>B_\r(x,\e)</m> in the metric space induced by <m>\r</m>.
            Clearly <m>x \in B_\r(x,\e)</m> so consider any <m>y \in B_\r(x,\e)</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(y,x) = \max\braces{d_1(y_1,x_1), \ldots, d_n(y_n, x_n)} \lt  \e \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, for any <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>d_i(y_i,x_i) \leq \r(x,\e) \lt  \e \leq \e_i</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>y_i \in B_{d_i}(x_i,\e_i) \ss U_i</m>.
            Since this is true of any <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>,
            it follows that <m>y \in \prod_{i=1}^n U_i = B</m>.
            We can then conclude that <m>x \in B_\r(x,\e) \ss B</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that the <m>\r</m>-metric topology is finer than the product topology,
            again by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            Hence the two topologies are the same as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that the metric <m>D</m> is well-defined and is in fact a metric.
            In what follows suppose that <m>x,y,z \in \prod X_i</m>.
            For any <m>j \in \pints</m> we have that
            <m>0 \lt  1 \leq j</m> so that <m>1/j \leq 1</m>.
            We also have that <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j) = \min\braces{d_j(x_j,y_j), 1} \leq 1</m> so that <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j) / j \leq 1/j \leq 1</m>.
            Hence <m>1</m> is an upper bound for the set
            <m>\braces{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)/i}</m> since <m>j</m> was arbitrary, so that
            <md>
              <mrow>D(x,y) = \sup\braces{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)/i}</mrow>
            </md>
            exists and hence <m>D</m> is well defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show part<nbsp/>(1) of the definition of a metric,
            pick any <m>j \in \pints</m> so that clearly <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j) \geq 0</m> and hence
            <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j)/j \geq 0</m> also since <m>j \geq 1 > 0</m>.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>D(x,y) = \sup\braces{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)/i} \geq \bd_j(x_j,y_j)/j \geq 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>x = y</m> then we have that
            <m>x_j = y_j</m> for any <m>j \in \pints</m>.
            Thus <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j) = 0</m> since <m>\bd_j</m> is a standard bounded metric,
            and therefore
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{\bd_j(x_j,y_j)}{j} = \frac{0}{j} = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>j</m> was arbitrary, this shows that
            <md>
              <mrow>D(x,y) = \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)}{j}} = \sup\braces{0} = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if <m>D(x,y) = 0</m> then,
            for any <m>j \in \pints</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>0 \leq \frac{\bd_j(x_j,y_j)}{j} \leq \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)}{i}} = D(x,y) = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j)/j = 0</m> so that clearly <m>\bd_j(x_j,y_j) = 0</m> as well,
            from which it follows that
            <m>x_j = y_j</m> since <m>\bd_j</m> is a standard bounded metric.
            Since <m>j</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>x = y</m>,
            which completes the proof of part<nbsp/>(1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Showing part<nbsp/>(2) is quite easy:
            <md>
              <mrow>D(x,y) = \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)}{i}} = \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(y_i,x_i)}{i}} = D(x,y)</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\bd_i</m> is a standard bounded metric for every <m>i \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For part<nbsp/>(3) consider any <m>j \in \pints</m>.
            Then
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd_j(x_j,z_j) \leq \bd_j(x_j,y_j) + \bd_j(y_j,z_j)</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\bd_j</m> is a standard bounded metric.
            Then of course
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{\bd_j(x_j,z_j)}{j} \leq \frac{\bd_j(x_j,y_j) + \bd_j(y_j,z_j)}{j} = \frac{\bd_j(x_j,y_j)}{j} + \frac{\bd_j(y_j,z_j)}{j}</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>j \geq 1 > 0</m>.
            Then, since <m>j</m> was arbitrary this shows that

              <mrow>D(x,z) \amp = \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(x_i,z_i)}{i}} \leq \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(x_i,y_i)}{i} + \frac{\bd_i(y_i,z_i)}{i}}</mrow>

            This of course completes the proof that <m>D</m> is a well defined metric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that the metric topology induced by <m>D</m> is the same as the product topology on <m>\prod X_i</m>,
            which we do using Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            So consider any <m>x \in \prod X_i</m> and any basis element of the metric topology
            <m>B_D(x,\e)</m> centered at <m>x</m>.
            Clearly there is a positive integer <m>N</m> large enough such that <m>N > 2/\e</m>,
            and so <m>1/N \lt  \e/2</m>.
            Now define the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>U_i = \begin{cases}B_{d_i}(x_i,\e/2) \amp  i \lt  N \\ \reals \amp  i \geq N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>i \in \pints</m>, and the set <m>B = \prod U_i</m>.
            Clearly <m>B</m> is a basis element of the product topology since each <m>U_i</m> is open in <m>X_i</m> and
            <m>U_i \neq \reals</m> for only finitely many <m>i</m>,
            namely when <m>i \lt  N</m>.
            Clearly also <m>x \in B</m> since each <m>x_i \in U_i</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>y \in B</m> and consider any <m>j \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>j \lt  N</m> then we of course have that <m>y_j \in U_j = B_{d_j}(x_j, \e/2)</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{\bd_j(y_j,x_j)}{j} \leq \bd_j(y_j,x_j) \leq d_j(y_j,x_j) \lt  \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>j \geq 1</m>.
            If <m>j \geq N</m> then we have <m>1/j \leq 1/N</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{\bd_j(y_i,x_i)}{j} \leq \frac{1}{j} \leq \frac{1}{N} \lt  \frac{\e}{2}</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>\bd_j(y_j,x_j) \leq 1</m>.
            Since <m>j</m> was arbitrary, this shows that
            <md>
              <mrow>D(y,x) = \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(y_i,x_i)}{i}} \leq \frac{\e}{2} \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>y \in B_D(x,\e)</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in B \ss B_D(x,\e)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence the product topology is finer than the metric topology by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now again consider any <m>x \in \prod X_i</m> and any basis element
            <m>B = \prod U_i</m> of the product topology where <m>x \in B</m>.
            Then of course each <m>U_i</m> is open in <m>X_i</m> and there is a finite subset <m>J \ss \pints</m> where
            <m>U_i = \reals</m> for every <m>i \notin J</m>.
            Of course also <m>x \in U_i</m> for each <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            For any <m>j \in J</m> we have that
            <m>x \in U_j</m> and <m>U_j</m> is open in <m>X_i</m> so that there is a basis element
            <m>B_{d_j}(x_j, \e_j)</m> such that <m>B_{d_j}(x_j, \e_j) \ss U_j</m>.
            So let <m>\e = \min(\braces{\e_j \where j \in J} \cup \braces{1})</m> and <m>k = \max\braces{j \where j \in J}</m>,
            which both exists since <m>J</m> is finite,
            and also clearly <m>\e > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider the set <m>B_D(x,\e/k)</m>,
            which is a basis element of the metric topology that clearly contains <m>x</m>.
            Suppose that <m>y \in B_D(x,\e/k)</m> so that <m>D(y,x) \lt  \e/k</m>.
            Then, for any <m>j \in \pints</m>,
            clearly <m>y_i \in \reals = U_i</m> if <m>j \neq J</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>j \in J</m> then we have that
            <m>k \geq j</m> so that <m>1/k \leq 1/j</m>.
            We also have
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{\bd(y_j,x_j)}{j} \leq \sup\braces{\frac{\bd_i(y_i,x_i)}{i}} = D(y,x) \lt  \frac{\e}{k} \leq \frac{\e}{j} \leq \frac{1}{j}</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>1/k \leq 1/j</m> and <m>\e \leq 1</m>.
            Therefore <m>\bd_j(y_j,x_j) \lt  1</m> so that it must be that <m>\bd_j(y_j,x_j) = d_j(y_j,x_j)</m>.
            Hence we have <m>d_j(y_j,x_j) = \bd_j(y_j,x_j) \lt  \e \leq \e_j</m> so that <m>y_j \in B_{d_j}(x_j,\e_j) \ss U_j</m>.
            Therefore <m>y_i \in U_i</m> for all
            <m>i \in \pints</m> so that <m>y \in \prod U_i = B</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>x \in B_D(x,\e) \ss B</m>,
            which in turn proves that the metric topology is also finer than the product topology by Lemma<nbsp/>13.3.
            Thus the two topologies must be the same.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>\realsl</m> and the ordered square satisfy the first countability axiom.
          (This result does not, of course,
          imply that they are metrizable.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x</m> is any element of <m>\realsl</m>.
            Define the sets <m>U_n = \clop{x,x+1/n}</m> for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly this is a countable collection of neighborhoods of <m>x</m> since each <m>U_n</m> is a basis element of <m>\realsl</m> and <m>x \in U_n</m>.
            Now consider any other neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> so that there is a basis element
            <m>B = \clop{a,b}</m> that contains <m>x</m> and <m>B \ss U</m>.
            Thus of course <m>a \leq x \lt  b</m>.
            There is clearly a positive integer <m>N</m> large enough that <m>N > 1/(b-x)</m>,
            noting that <m>b-x > 0</m> since <m>x \lt  b</m>.
            Now consider any <m>y \in U_N = \clop{x,x+1/N}</m> so that <m>x \leq y \lt  x+1/N</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{1}{b-x} \amp \lt  N</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{1}{N} \amp \lt  b - x \amp  \text{ (since both \(N \geq 1 > 0\) and \(b-x>0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>x + \frac{1}{N} \amp \lt  b</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>y \leq x + 1/N \lt  b</m>.
            As we also clearly have <m>a \leq x \leq y</m> it follows that <m>y \in \clop{a,b} = B \ss U</m>.
            Thus <m>U_N \ss U</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>\realsl</m> satisfies the first countability axiom since <m>U</m> and <m>x</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now recall that the ordered square is the set <m>I \times I</m> where
            <m>I = [0,1]</m> with the dictionary order topology.
            In what follows let <m>\prec</m> denote the dictionary order on <m>I \times I</m>.
            So suppose that <m>\vx = x_1 \times x_2 \in I \times I</m> so that of course
            <m>0 \leq x_1 \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq x_2 \leq 1</m>.
            Now define the following
            <md>
              <mrow>a_{n,1} \amp = \begin{cases} \max\braces{x_1-1/n, 0} \amp  x_2 = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 \amp  x_2 > 0 \end{cases} \amp b_{n,1} \amp = \begin{cases} \min\braces{x_1+1/n, 1} \amp  x_2 = 1</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 \amp  x_2 \lt  1 \end{cases}</mrow>
              <mrow>a_{n,2} \amp = \max\braces{x_2-1/n,0} \amp b_{n,2} \amp = \min\braces{x_2+1/n,1}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            which are all well defined since it is never the case that <m>x_2 \lt  0</m> or <m>x_2 > 1</m>.
            Also define <m>\va_n = a_{n,1} \times a_{n,2}</m> and
            <m>\vb_n = b_{n,1} \times b_{n,2}</m> for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Lastly, define the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>U_n = \begin{cases}\clop{\va_n, \vb_n} \amp  x_1 = x_2 = 0 \\ \opcl{\va_n, \vb_n} \amp  x_1 = x_2 = 1 \\ (\va_n, \vb_n) \amp  \text{ otherwise } \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            noting that the intervals are in the dictionary order so that these are basis elements of the dictionary order topology and so are open.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it is not obvious with all the different cases going on,
            we now show that <m>\vx \in U_n</m> for every <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            So consider any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_2 = 0</m>.
            Then we have <m>b_{n,1} = x_1</m> and <m>x_2 \lt \min\braces{x_2+1/n,1} = b_{n,2}</m> since
            <m>x_2 = 0 \lt 1</m> and clearly <m>x_2 \lt x_2+1/n</m>.
            This shows that <m>\vx \prec \vb_n</m>. \begin{indpar} Case:
            <m>x_1 = 0</m>.
            Then we clearly have that <m>x_1-1/n \lt x_1 = 0</m>,
            and hence <m>a_{n,1} = \max\braces{x_1-1/n,0} = 0 = x_1</m>.
            Also clearly <m>a_{n,1} = 0 = x_2</m> since <m>x_2 = 0</m>.
            Hence <m>\va_n = 0 \times 0 = \vx</m> so that <m>\va_n \prece \vx</m> is true.
            This shows that <m>\vx \in \clop{\va_n,\vb_n} = U_n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 > 0</m>.
            Then we have <m>x_1-1/n \lt x_1</m> and
            <m>0 \lt x_1</m> so that <m>a_{n,1} = \max\braces{x_1-1/n,0} \lt x_1</m>.
            Therefore <m>\va_n \prec \vx</m> so that <m>\vx \in (\va_n, \vb_n) = U_n</m>. \end{indpar}
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_2 = 1</m>.
            Then we have <m>a_{n,1} = x_1</m> and <m>a_{n,2} = \max\braces{x_2-1/n,0} \lt x_2</m> since
            <m>x_2 = 1 > 0</m> and clearly <m>x_2 > x_2-1/n</m>.
            This shows that <m>\va_n \prec \vx</m>. \begin{indpar} Case:
            <m>x_1 = 1</m>.
            Then <m>x_1+1/n > x_1 = 1</m> so that <m>b_{n,1} = \min\braces{x_1+1/n,1} = 1 = x_1</m>.
            Likewise we have that <m>x_2+1/n > x_2 = 1</m> so that <m>b_{n,2} = \min\braces{x_2+1/n, 1} = 1</m>.
            Thus <m>\vb_n = 1 \times 1 = \vx</m> and hence <m>\vx \prece \vb_n</m> is true.
            Therefore <m>\vx \in \opcl{\va_n, \vb_n} = U_n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 \lt 1</m>.
            Then we have <m>x_1+1/n > x_1</m> and <m>1 > x_1</m> so that <m>b_{n,1} = \min\braces{x_1+1/n,1} > x_1</m>.
            Therefore <m>\vx \prec \vb_n</m> so that <m>\vx \in (\va_n, \vb_n) = U_n</m>. \end{indpar}
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>0 \lt x_2 \lt 1</m>.
            Then <m>a_{n,1} = x_1</m>,
            and <m>x_2-1/n \lt x_2</m> and
            <m>0 \lt x_2</m> so that <m>a_{n,2} = \max\braces{x_2-1/n,0} \lt x_2</m>.
            This shows that <m>\va_n \prec \vx</m>.
            Similarly <m>b_{n,1} = x_1</m>,
            and <m>x_2+1/n > x_2</m> and <m>1 > x_2</m> so that <m>b_{n,2} = \min\braces{x_2+1/n,1} > x_2</m>.
            This shows that <m>\vx \prec \vb_n</m>.
            Therefore we have <m>\vx \in (\va_n,\vb_n) = U_n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence <m>\vx \in U_n</m> in all of the exhaustive cases so that
            <m>\braces{U_n}_{n \in \pints}</m> is a countable collection of neighborhoods of <m>\vx</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly consider any other neighborhood of <m>U</m> of <m>\vx</m> in the dictionary order topology.
            Then there is a basis element <m>B</m> of the dictionary order topology such that <m>\vx \in B \ss U</m>.
            Then we have that either <m>B = \clop{\vc, \vd}</m> where
            <m>\vc = \vze</m>, <m>B = (\vc, \vd)</m>,
            or <m>B = \opcl{\vc, \vd}</m> where <m>\vd = \vone</m>
            (where we denote <m>\vone = 1 \times 1</m>).
            Now we set <m>N_a,N_b \in \pints</m> based on the different cases we might have.
            First, we know that no matter what we have
            <m>\vc \prece \vx</m> since <m>\vx\in B</m>.
            We therefore have:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>c_1 \lt x_1</m>.
            If <m>x_2 > 0</m> then set <m>N_a = 1</m>,
            and otherwise <m>x_2 = 0</m> and there is an <m>N_a</m> large enough such that <m>N_a > 1/(x_1-c_1)</m>,
            noting that this is defined since <m>x_1-c_1>0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>c_1 = x_1</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>c_2 \leq x_2</m> since <m>\vc \prece \vx</m>.
            If <m>c_2 = x_2</m> then it must be that
            <m>B = \clop{\vc, \vd}</m> and <m>\vc = \vx = \vze</m>,
            so just set <m>N_a = 1</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>c_2 \lt x_2</m>,
            then there must be an <m>N_a</m> large enough such that <m>N_a > 1/(x_2-c_2)</m>,
            noting that <m>x_2 - c_2 > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we set <m>N_b</m> in an analogous way,
            noting that we have <m>\vx \prece \vd</m> no matter what since <m>\vx \in B</m>:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 \lt d_1</m>.
            If <m>x_2 \lt 1</m> then simply set <m>N_b = 1</m>,
            and otherwise <m>x_2 = 1</m> and there is an <m>N_b</m> large enough such that <m>N_b > 1/(d_1-x_1)</m>,
            noting that <m>d_1-x_1 > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 = d_1</m>.
            Then it must be that <m>x_2 \leq d_2</m> since <m>\vx \prece \vd</m>.
            If <m>x_2 = d_2</m> then it has to be that
            <m>B = \opcl{\vc, \vd}</m> and <m>\vx = \vd = \vone</m>,
            so just set <m>N_b = 1</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>x_2 \lt d_2</m>,
            then there is an <m>N_b</m> large enough such that <m>N_b > 1/(d_2-x_2)</m>,
            noting that <m>d_2-x_2 > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>N = \max\braces{N_a, N_b}</m>,
            and we claim that <m>U_N \ss B</m> in every case.
            We have again know that <m>\vc \prece \vx</m> so that we have:
          </p>

            Case: <m>c_1 \lt x_1</m>.
            If <m>x_2 > 0</m> then <m>c_1 \lt x_1 = a_{N,1}</m>.
            If <m>x_2 = 0</m> then we have <m>N \geq N_a > 1/(x_1-c_1)</m>,
            from which it readily follows that <m>c_1 \lt x_1 - 1/n \leq a_{N,1}</m>.
            Thus either way we have <m>c_1 \lt a_{N,1}</m> so that <m>\vc \prec \va_N</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>c_1 = x_1</m>.
            If also <m>c_2 = x_2</m> then again it has to be that
            <m>B = \clop{\vc, \vd}</m> and <m>\vc = \vx = \vze</m>.
            In this case it was established above that
            <m>U_N = \clop{\va_N, \vb_N}</m> and <m>\va_N = \vze</m>.
            So we have here that <m>\vc = \vze \prece \vze = \va_N</m>.
            On the other hand if <m>c_2 \lt x_2</m> then <m>N \geq N_a > 1/(x_2-c_2)</m>,
            from which it follows that <m>c_2 \lt x_2 - 1/n \leq a_{N,2}</m>.
            Also <m>c_1 = x_1 = a_{N,1}</m> so that
            <m>\vc \prec \va_N</m> since <m>0 \leq c_2 \lt x_2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also of course again have that <m>\vx \prece \vd</m> so that

          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 \lt d_1</m>.
            If <m>x_2 \lt 1</m> then <m>b_{N,1} = x_1 \lt d_1</m>.
            If <m>x_2 = 1</m> then we have <m>N \geq N_b > 1/(d_1-x_1)</m>,
            from which it follows that <m>b_{N,1} \leq x_1 + 1/N \lt d_1</m>.
            Hence either was <m>b_{N,1} \lt d_1</m> so that <m>\vb_N \prec \vd</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 = d_1</m>.
            If also <m>x_2 = d_2</m> then again it has to be that
            <m>B = \opcl{\vc, \vd}</m> and <m>\vd = \vx = \vone</m>.
            In this case it was established above that
            <m>U_N = \opcl{\va_N, \vb_N}</m> and <m>\vb_N = \vone</m>.
            So we have here that <m>\vb_N = \vone \prece \vone = \vd</m>.
            On the other hand if <m>x_2 \lt d_2</m> then we have <m>N \geq N_b > 1/(d_2-x_2)</m>,
            from which it readily follows that <m>b_{N,2} \leq x_2+1/N \lt d_2</m>.
            We also have <m>b_{N,1} = x_1 = d_1</m> so that
            <m>\vb_N \prec \vd</m> since <m>x_2 \lt d_2 \leq 1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore in every case we have that
            <m>\vc \prec \va_N</m> except when <m>\vc = \vx = \va_N = \vze</m> so that
            <m>U_N = \clop{\vze, \vb_N}</m> and <m>B = \clop{\vze, \vd}</m>.
            Similarly we always have <m>\vb_N \prec \vd</m> except when <m>\vb_N = \vx = \vd = \vone</m> so that
            <m>U_N = \opcl{\va_N, \vone}</m> and <m>B = \opcl{\vc, \vone}</m>.
            When <m>\vc = \vx = \va_N = \vze</m> we cannot have <m>\vx = \vone</m>,
            so that <m>\vb_N \prec \vd</m>.
            Analogously,
            when <m>\vb_N = \vx = \vd = \vone</m> it cannot be that <m>\vx = \vze</m>,
            and hence <m>\vc \prec \va_N</m>.
            Otherwise we have <m>U_N = (\va_N, \vb_N)</m>, <m>\vc \prec \va_N</m>,
            and <m>\vb_N \prec \vd</m> so that in every case <m>\vx \in U_N \ss B \ss U</m>.
            Since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood and <m>\vx</m> was also arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>I \times I</m> satisfies the first countability axiom as desired.

            First, we have that the sequence
            <m>x_n \times y_n</m> converges to <m>x \times y</m> in the product space
            <m>\reals \times \reals</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>19.6 since both
            <m>x_n \to x</m> and <m>y_n \to y</m> in <m>\reals</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>f : \reals \times \reals \to \reals</m> is continuous.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n \times y_n) = f\parens{\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n \times y_n} = f(x \times y)</mrow>
            </md>
            by Theorem<nbsp/>21.3.
            Now, we have that addition, subtraction,
            and multiplication are all continuous functions from
            <m>\reals \times \reals</m> to <m>\reals</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>21.4.
            It then follows that for the continuous function <m>+: \reals \times \reals \to \reals</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\lim_{n \to \infty} (x_n + y_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} +(x_n \times y_n) = +(x \times y) = x + y \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It similarly follows that <m>x_n - y_n \to x - y</m> and <m>x_n y_n \to x y</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the quotient,
            we note that <m>(y_n)</m> is a sequence in the subspace topology
            <m>\realsnz</m> since each <m>y_n \neq 0</m>.
            We also note that <m>y \neq 0</m> and hence also
            <m>y \in \realsnz</m> so that the sequence <m>(y_n)</m> converges to a point still within the space <m>\realsnz</m>.
            It then again follows that <m>x_n \times y_n \to x \times y</m> in the product space
            <m>\reals \times (\realsnz)</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>19.6.
            Since the quotient function is continuous from
            <m>\reals \times (\realsnz)</m> to <m>\reals</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>21.4, it then follows as before that
            <m>x_n/y_n \to x/y</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>21.3 just as we would like.

            Suppose that <m>(f_n)</m> converges pointwise to two distinct functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.

            As <m>Y</m> is Hausdorff,

              If <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly to a function <m>f</m>,

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly to <m>f</m> and consider any <m>x_0 \in X</m> and <m>\e > 0</m>.
            Then there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where

            Since <m>x_0</m> was arbitrary,

        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> converges pointwise to the function <m>g: [0,1] \to \reals</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>g(x) = \begin{cases}0 \amp  x \lt  1 \\ 1 \amp  x = 1 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>x \in [0,1]</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>(f_n(x))</m> converges for each
            <m>x \in [0,1]</m> by <xref ref="def_metricc_pointwise">Definition</xref>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any such <m>x \in [0,1]</m> so that we have the following exhaustive cases:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x = 0</m>.
            Then <m>f_n(x) = x^n = 0^n = 0</m> for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Thus clearly the sequence <m>(f_n(x)) = (0,0,\ldots)</m> converges to <m>0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x = 1</m>.
            Somewhat similarly we have <m>f_n(x) = x^n = 1^n = 1</m> for every
            <m>n \in \pints</m> so that clearly the sequence
            <m>(f_n(x)) = (1,1,\ldots)</m> converges to <m>1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>0 \lt  x \lt  1</m>.
            Here we show that, for any <m>x \in (0,1)</m>,
            that the sequence <m>(f_n(x))</m> is strictly decreasing and that it is bounded below by <m>0</m>.
            We prove this using induction on <m>n</m>.
            So first for <m>n = 1</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>0 \lt  x \amp \lt  1</mrow>

            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the inductive step suppose that
            <m>f_n(x) > 0</m> and <m>f_{n+1}(x) \lt  f_n(x)</m>.
            Then we of course have <m>0 \lt  f_n(x) = x^n</m> so that clearly
            <m>0 = x \cdot 0 \lt  x \cdot x^n = x^{n+1} = f_{n+1}(x)</m> as well since <m>x > 0</m>.
            We also clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>f_{n+1} \amp \lt  f_n(x)</mrow>
              <mrow>x^{n+1} \amp \lt  x^n</mrow>
              <mrow>x \cdot x^{n+1} \amp \lt  x \cdot x^n \amp  \text{ (since \(x > 0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>x^{n+2} \amp \lt  x^{n+1}</mrow>
              <mrow>f_{n+2}(x) \amp \lt  f_{n+1}(x) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which completes the inductive step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence the sequence is strictly decreasing
            (and therefore of course non-increasing)
            and bounded below by zero,
            from which it follows that it converges by a theorem analogous in an obvious way to that shown in Exercise<nbsp/>21.11 part<nbsp/>(a).
            So suppose that the sequence converges to the value <m>a</m>.
            Then of course also the sequence
            <m>(f_{n+1}(x))</m> must also converge to <m>a</m>.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>a = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_{n+1}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} x^{n+1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} x \cdot x^n = \lim_{n \to \infty} x f_n(x) = x \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = xa \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where we note that clearly the function <m>h(y) = xy</m> for
            <m>y \in \reals</m> is clearly continuous so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\lim_{n \to \infty} x f_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} h(f_n(x)) = h\parens{\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)} = x \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)</mrow>
            </md>
            by Theorem<nbsp/>21.3.
            Therefore we have <m>a = xa</m> so that it would be that <m>1 = x</m> if <m>a</m> were any nonzero value.
            However, we know that <m>x \lt  1</m> so it must be that <m>a = 0</m>.
            This completes the proof that <m>(f_n)</m> converges pointwise to <m>g</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then becomes fairly easy to show that
            <m>(f_n(x))</m> does not converge uniformly.
            Consider any function <m>f: [0,1] \to \reals</m>.
            If <m>f \neq g</m> then <m>(f_n)</m> cannot converge pointwise to <m>f</m> since it was shown to converge pointwise to <m>g</m> above and <m>g</m> is unique by <xref ref="lem_metricc_pwunique">Lemma</xref>
            since <m>\reals</m> is Hausdorff.
            Hence <m>(f_n)</m> cannot converge uniformly to <m>f</m> by the converse of <xref ref="lem_metricc_unifpw">Lemma</xref>
            since it does even not converge pointwise.
            On the other hand if <m>f = g</m> then clearly <m>f = g</m> has a discontinuity at <m>1</m> so that it is not continuous.
            However each <m>f_n(x) = x^n</m> is continuous on <m>[0,1]</m> by elementary calculus.
            This shows that <m>(f_n)</m> cannot converge uniformly to <m>f=g</m> since this would violate Theorem<nbsp/>21.6.

        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> First suppose that <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly to <m>f</m> in the functional sense.
            Consider any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            Then, by the definition of uniform convergence there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where
            <md>
              <mrow>d(f_n(x), f(x)) \lt  \e/2</mrow>
            </md>
            for all <m>n > N</m> and <m>x \in X</m>,
            noting that <m>d</m> of course denotes the usual metric on <m>\reals</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x_0 \in X</m> and an
            <m>n \geq N+1</m> so that <m>n > N</m>.
            Then of course we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) = \min\braces{d(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)), 1} \leq d(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) \lt  \e/2\,</mrow>
            </md>,
            from which it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\br(f_n, f) = \sup\braces{\bd(f_n(x),f(x)) \where x \in X} \leq \e/2 \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>x_0</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>f_n \in B_{\br}(f, \e)</m>.
            Since <m>n \geq N+1</m> and <m>\e > 0</m> were both arbitrary,
            this shows that the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> converges to <m>f</m> as elements of the metric space <m>\reals^X</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that <m>(f_n)</m> converges to <m>f</m> in the uniform metric space <m>\reals^X</m>.
            Consider any <m>\e > 0</m> and let <m>\d = \min\braces{\e,1}</m>.
            Then, since <m>B_{\br}(f,\d)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f</m> in the uniform metric space,
            there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where
            <m>f_n \in B_{\br}(f,\d)</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
            So consider any <m>n > N</m> and <m>x_0 \in X</m>.
            Then clearly <m>f_n \in B_{\br}(f,\d)</m> so that <m>\br(f_n,f) \lt  \d</m>.
            Hence
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) \leq \sup\braces{\bd(f_n(x),f(x)) \where x \in X} = \br(f_n,f)  \lt  \d \leq 1</mrow>
            </md>
            so it has to be that <m>d(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) = \bd(f_n(x_0),f(x_0))</m> since
            <md>
              <mrow>\bd(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) = \min\braces{d(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)), 1} \lt  1 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore we have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) = \bd(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) \leq \br(f_n,f) \lt  \d \leq \e \,</mrow>

            Since <m>n > N</m>, <m>x_0 \in X</m>,

          Show that if the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly to <m>f</m>,

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>(f_n)</m> converges to <m>f</m> uniformly and let <m>d</m> denote the metric for <m>Y</m>.
            Consider any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            Since <m>(f_n)</m> converges to <m>f</m> uniformly there is an <m>N_1 \in \pints</m> where
            <m>d(f_n(x'),f(x')) \lt \e/2</m> for any <m>n > N_1</m> and <m>x' \in X</m>.
            We also know from the uniform limit theorem (Theorem<nbsp/>21.6) that <m>f</m> is continuous since each <m>f_n</m> is continuous.
            It then follows from Theorem<nbsp/>21.3 that the sequence
            <m>(f(x_n))</m> converges to <m>f(x)</m> since <m>x_n \to x</m>.
            Hence there is an <m>N_2 \in \pints</m> such that
            <m>d(f(x_n),f(x)) \lt \e/2</m> for all <m>n \geq N_2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So set <m>N = \max\braces{N_1+1, N_2}</m> and consider any <m>n \geq N</m>.
            Then of course <m>n \geq N \geq N_1+1 > N_1</m> and <m>x_n \in X</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>d(f_n(x_n), f(x_n)) \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have that <m>n \geq N \geq N_2</m> so that

              <mrow>d(f(x_n),f(x)) \lt  \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have

            </md>
            since <m>d</m> is a metric, and so <m>f_n(x_n) \in B_d(f(x),\e)</m>.
            Since <m>n \geq N</m> and <m>\e > 0</m> were arbitrary,
            we have shown that the sequence
            <m>(f_n(x_n))</m> converges to <m>f(x)</m> in the metric space <m>Y</m> by definition.

            This is easy to show by evaluating the limit using techniques from elementary calculus.
            Fix <m>x \in \reals</m> and first suppose that <m>x \neq 0</m>.
            Clearly <m>1/n \to 0</m> as
            <m>n \to \infty</m> so that <m>[x-(1/n)]^2 \to x^2</m>.
            Since <m>x^2 > 0</m> it follows that
            <m>n^3 [x - (1/n)]^2 \to n^3 x^2 \to \infty</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
            Hence the overall function
            <md>
              <mrow>f_n(x) = \frac{1}{n^3 [x-(1/n)]^2 + 1} \to \frac{1}{\infty + 1} \to 0 = f(x)</mrow>
            </md>
            as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
            Of course this is a little informal,
            but it can be justified rigorously using nothing more than Exercise<nbsp/>21.5.
            If <m>x = 0</m> then we clearly have

              <mrow>f_n(x) = f_n(0) = \frac{1}{n^3 [-(1/n)]^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{n^3/n^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{n+1} \to 0 = f(x)</mrow>

          Note that this also shows that <m>(f_n)</m> does not uniformly converge to any function at all since,

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Regarding the set <m>A</m>,
            the function <m>f: \reals \times \reals \to \reals</m> defined by
            <m>f(x \times y) = xy</m> is simply the multiplication function,
            which is continuous by Lemma<nbsp/>21.4.
            Clearly the set <m>A = \ivf(\braces{1})</m> by definition.
            We also have that <m>\braces{1}</m> is closed in <m>\reals</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>17.8 since <m>\reals</m> is Hausdorff.
            Thus <m>A = \ivf(\braces{1})</m> is closed in
            <m>\reals \times \reals = \reals^2</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>f</m> is continuous.

          <p>
            For <m>S^1</m>,
            let <m>d</m> denote the usual euclidean metric on <m>\reals \times \reals</m>,
            which we know induces the same topology as the product topology.
            We also know from Exercise<nbsp/>20.3 that <m>d: \reals \times \reals \to \reals</m> is continuous.
            The function <m>f: \reals \times \reals \to \reals</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x \times y) = d(x,y) \cdot d(x,y) = [d(x,y)]^2 = \squares{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}^2 = x^2 + y^2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
            is also then continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>21.5 being the product of two continuous functions.
            As previously mentioned,
            the finite set <m>\braces{1}</m> is closed in <m>\reals</m>.
            We also have that <m>S^1 = \ivf(\braces{1})</m> by definition,
            which then also must be closed in
            <m>\reals \times \reals = \reals^2</m> again by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>f</m> continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the closed unit ball <m>B^2</m>,
            define <m>f = d \cdot d</m> as above for <m>S^1</m>,
            which is of course still continuous.
            Define the subset <m>C = \braces{x \in \reals \where 0 \leq x \leq 1}</m> of <m>\reals</m>.
            We claim that <m>B^2 = \ivf(C)</m>.
            This is pretty obvious since clearly <m>0 \leq f(x \times y) = x^2 + y^2 \leq 1</m> for any
            <m>x \times y \in B^2</m> by definition so that
            <m>f(x \times y) \in C</m> and hence <m>x \times y \in \ivf(C)</m>.
            Conversely, for any <m>x \times y \in \ivf(C)</m>,
            we have that <m>f(x \times y) \in C</m> so that
            <m>0 \leq f(x \times y) = x^2 + y^2 \leq 1</m> so that <m>x \times y \in B^2</m> by definition.
            This shows the desired equality of <m>B^2</m> and <m>\ivf(C)</m>.
            As it is trivial to show that <m>C</m> is closed in <m>\reals</m>,
            and <m>f</m> is continuous,
            it follows that <m>B^2 = \ivf(C)</m> is also closed in <m>\reals \times \reals = \reals^2</m>,
            again by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Clearly image of the sequence
            <m>S = \braces{s_n \where n \in \pints}</m> is a set of real numbers that is bounded above since the sequence is bounded above.
            Therefore <m>s = \sup S</m> exists,
            noting that of course <m>s_n \leq s</m> for any
            <m>n \in \pints</m> since <m>s_n \in S</m>.
            We claim that <m>s_n \to s</m>.
            So consider any <m>\e > 0</m> so that clearly <m>s-\e \lt  s</m>,
            and hence <m>s-\e</m> cannot be an upper bound of <m>S</m>
            (since <m>s</m> is the least upper bound).
            Thus there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where <m>s - \e \lt  s_N</m>.
            Then, for any <m>n \geq N</m> we have that
            <m>s-\e \lt  S_N \leq s_n \leq s</m> since the sequence is non-decreasing.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>s - \e \lt  s_n</mrow>

              <mrow>d(s_n, s) \lt  \e</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>s \geq s_n</m>,
            where <m>d</m> denotes the usual metric on <m>\reals</m>.
            Hence <m>s_n \in B_d(s, \e)</m>,
            which shows that the sequence converges to <m>s</m> since
            <m>n \geq N</m> and <m>\e</m> were arbitrary.

            <m>t_n \to t</m> by the definition of infinite series.
            Also define the constant sequence <m>c_n = c</m> for real <m>c</m>,
            so that of course <m>c_n \to c</m>.
            For any <m>n \in \pints</m>, we of course have

              <mrow>c_n s_n + t_n = c \sum_{i=1}^n a_i + \sum_{i=1}^n b_i = \sum_{i=1}^n c a_i + \sum_{i=1}^n b_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (c a_i + b_i)</mrow>
            </md>
            since these are just finite sums.
            It then follows from what was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>21.5 that
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty (c a_i + b_i) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n (c a_i + b_i) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (c_n s_n + t_n) = cs + t</mrow>

          <p>
            We know that <m>(t_n)</m> converges by the definition of an infinite series,
            since <m>\sum b_i</m> converges.
            So suppose that <m>t_n \to t</m>.
            We also clearly have that <m>0 \leq \abs{a_i} \leq b_i</m> for all <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            so that each term in both sums is always non-negative.
            It then follows that the sequence of partial sums <m>(s_n)</m> and <m>(t_n)</m> are non-decreasing,
            and moreover that <m>t_n \leq t</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Lastly, since each <m>\abs{a_i} \leq b_i</m>,
            it follows from a simple inductive argument that each <m>s_n \leq t_n \leq t</m>.
            Hence <m>(s_n)</m> is a non-decreasing sequence that is also bounded
            (by <m>t</m>),
            and so it converges by part<nbsp/>(a).
            Therefore the infinite series
            <m>\sum \abs{a_i}</m> converges by definition.
            Denote its convergence value by <m>u</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we also have that clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>-\abs{a_i} \leq a_i \leq \abs{a_i}</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \leq \abs{a_i} + a_i \leq 2 \abs{a_i}</mrow>
            </md>
            for every <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            and that <m>\sum 2\abs{a_i}</m> converges to <m>2u</m> by what was shown in part<nbsp/>(b).
            Therefore, by the same argument as above,
            the sequence of partial sums of
            <m>\sum (\abs{a_i} + a_i)</m> is non-decreasing and bounded by <m>2u</m> so that the series converges,
            say the the value <m>v</m>.
            Then, again by part<nbsp/>(b), we have that the series
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i = \sum_{i=1}^\infty (\abs{a_i} + a_i - \abs{a_i}) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \squares{(\abs{a_i} + a_i) + (-1)\abs{a_i}}</mrow>
            </md>
            converges to <m>v - u</m> since both <m>v = \sum (\abs{a_i} + a_i)</m> and
            <m>u = \sum \abs{a_i}</m> have been shown to converge.
            This shows the desired result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, since <m>\abs{f_i(x)} \leq M_i</m> for all <m>x \in X</m> and <m>\sum M_i</m> converges,
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(c) that the series
            <m>\sum f_i(x)</m> converges (as does the sequence
            <m>(s_n(x))</m>) for each <m>x \in X</m>.
            So set the function <m>s : X \to \reals</m> to
            <m>s(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n(x)</m> for each <m>x \in X</m>.
            Thus <m>(s_n)</m> converges pointwise to <m>s</m> by <xref ref="def_metricc_pointwise">Definition</xref>,
            and <m>s</m> can be thought of as the (pointwise) infinite sum of the functions <m>f_i</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>s_n \to s</m> uniformly, first define
            <md>
              <mrow>r_n = \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty M_i</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m> as the partial series of
            <m>\sum M_i</m> as in <xref ref="def_metric_pseries">Definition</xref>.
            Now consider any <m>x \in X</m>,
            any <m>n \in \pints</m>, and any <m>k > n</m>.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{s_k(x) - s_n(x)} = \abs{\sum_{i=1}^k f_i(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)} = \abs{\sum_{i=n+1}^k f_i(x)} \leq \sum_{i=n+1}^k \abs{f_i(x)} \leq \sum_{i=n+1}^k M_i \leq \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty M_i = r_n \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where we note that <m>\sum_{i=n+1}^k M_i \leq \sum_{i=n+1}^\infty M_i</m> since each <m>M_i</m> is non-negative.
            Since the absolute value function is continuous on <m>\reals</m>,
            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>21.3 and Exercise<nbsp/>21.5 that the sequence
            <m>\abs{s_k(x) - s_n(x)}</m> converges as <m>k \to \infty</m>,
            and moreover converges to <m>\abs{s(x) - s_n(x)}</m> since
            <m>s_k(x) \to s(x)</m> as <m>k \to \infty</m> as shown above.
            Then, since the above inequality holds for any <m>k > n</m>,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_metric_seqleq">Lemma</xref> that
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{s(x) - s_n(x)} = \lim_{k \to \infty} \abs{s_k(x) - s_n(x)} \leq \lim_{k \to \infty} r_n = r_n \,</mrow>

          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            We know from <xref ref="lem_metric_pseries">Lemma</xref>
            that the sequence of partial series <m>(r_n)</m> converges to zero since each <m>M_i</m> is non-negative.
            Hence there is an <m>N \in \pints</m> where
            <m>\abs{r_n - 0} \lt  \e</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
            Moreover, <xref ref="lem_metric_pseries">Lemma</xref>
            asserts that each <m>r_n \geq 0</m> so that
            <m>\abs{r_n - 0} = \abs{r_n} = r_n \lt  \e</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
            Thus, for any <m>n > N</m> and any <m>x \in X</m>, we have

              <mrow>\abs{s(x) - s_n(x)} \leq r_n \lt  \e \,</mrow>

            We again use Theorem<nbsp/>21.1 so show that the multiplication function <m>\times : \reals^2 \to \reals</m> is continuous.
            So consider any <m>x \times y \in \reals^2</m> and any <m>\e > 0</m>.
            Let
            <md>
              <mrow>\d = \min\braces{\frac{\e}{\abs{x_0} + \abs{y_0} + 1}, 1}</mrow>
            </md>
            so that of course <m>\d > 0</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x \times y \in \reals^2</m> where <m>\r(x \times y,x_0 \times y_0) \lt  \d</m>.
            Then of course
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(x \times y,x_0 \times y_0) = \max\braces{\abs{x-x_0},\abs{y-y_0}} \lt  \d</mrow>
            </md>
            so that both <m>\abs{x-x_0} \lt  \d</m> and <m>\abs{y-y_0} \lt  \d</m>.
            We then have
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\times(x \times y),\times(x_0 \times y_0)) \amp = d(xy, x_0 y_0) = \abs{xy - x_0 y_0}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \abs{xy - x_0 y_0 + (x_0 y - x_0 y) + (x y_0 - x y_0) + (x_0 y_0 - x_0 y_0)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \abs{(x_0 y - x_0 y_0) + (x y_0 - x_0 y_0) + (xy - x y_0 - x_0 y + x_0 y_0)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \abs{x_0(y-y_0) + y_0(x-x_0) + (x-x_0)(y-y_0)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \leq \abs{x_0(y-y_0)} + \abs{y_0(x-x_0)} + \abs{(x-x_0)(y-y_0)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \abs{x_0}\abs{y-y_0} + \abs{y_0}\abs{x-x_0} + \abs{x-x_0}\abs{y-y_0}</mrow>

              <mrow>\amp = \d (\abs{x_0} + \abs{y_0} + 1)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \leq \frac{\e}{\abs{x_0} + \abs{y_0} + 1} (\abs{x_0} + \abs{y_0} + 1)</mrow>

            where we have used the fact that <m>0 \lt  \d \leq 1</m>,
            from which it follows that <m>\d^2 \leq d</m>.
            This suffices to show that <times/> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>21.1 since <m>\e</m> was arbitrary.

            Define the reciprocal function
            <m>f: \realsnz \to \reals</m> by <m>f(x) = \rx</m>.
            To show that <m>f</m> is continuous,
            it suffices to show that <m>\ivf(B)</m> is open in
            <m>\realsnz</m> for every basis element <m>B</m> of <m>\reals</m>,
            which was shown back in &#xa7;18.
            So let <m>B = (a,b)</m> be any basis element of <m>\reals</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a > 0</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>0 \lt  a \lt  b</m>.
            We claim that <m>\ivf(B) = (\rb,\ra)</m>,
            noting that <m>0 \lt  \rb \lt  \ra</m> follows readily from the fact that <m>0 \lt  a \lt  b</m>.
            We have the following
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in (\rb,\ra) \amp \bic \rb \lt  x \lt  \ra \bic \rb \lt  x \land x \lt  \ra</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic 1 \lt  bx \land ax \lt  1 \bic \rx \lt  b \land a \lt  \rx</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic a \lt  \rx \lt  b \bic f(x) = \rx \in (a,b) = B</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in \ivf(B) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            noting that <m>x > a > 0</m> and <m>\rx > \rb > 0</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>\ivf(B) = (\rb,\ra)</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a = 0</m>.
            Then we have <m>0 = a \lt b</m> and hence also <m>0 \lt \rb</m>.
            We claim that <m>\ivf(B) = (\rb,\infty)</m>.
            So first suppose that <m>x \in \ivf(B)</m> so that <m>f(x) \in B = (a,b) = (0,b)</m>,
            and hence <m>0 \lt x \lt b</m>.
            Then <m>0 \lt 1 \lt b/x</m>,
            from which follows <m>0 \lt \rb \lt x</m> so that <m>x \in (\rb,\infty)</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x \in (\rb,\infty)</m> so that <m>0 \lt \rb \lt x</m>.
            Then <m>0 \lt 1 \lt bx</m> so that <m>0 \lt \rx \lt b</m>,
            and hence <m>f(x) = \rx \in (0,b) = (a,b) = B</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in \ivf(B)</m>,
            from which we conclude that <m>\ivf(B) = (\rb,\infty)</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a \lt 0</m>.
            Then also <m>\ra \lt 0</m> and we have the following sub-cases: \begin{indpar} Case:
            <m>b > 0</m>.
            Then also <m>\rb > 0</m>.
            Here we claim that <m>\ivf(B) = (-\infty,\ra) \cup (\rb,\infty)</m>.
            So suppose that <m>x \in \ivf(B)</m> so that <m>f(x) = \rx \in B = (a,b)</m>,
            and hence <m>a \lt \rx \lt b</m>.
            We know that <m>x \neq 0</m> since the domain of <m>f</m> is <m>\realsnz</m>.
            If <m>x \lt 0</m> then we have
            <m>a \lt \rx</m> so that <m>ax > 1</m>,
            and hence <m>x \lt \ra</m> since <m>a \lt 0</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in (\infty, \ra)</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>x > 0</m> then we have
            <m>\rx \lt b</m> so that <m>1 \lt bx</m>,
            and hence <m>\rb \lt x</m> since <m>b>0</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in (\rb,\infty)</m>.
            So either way <m>x \in (-\infty,\ra) \cup (\rb, \infty)</m> so that <m>\ivf(B) \ss (-\infty,\ra) \cup (\rb, \infty)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider <m>x \in (-\infty,\ra) \cup (\rb, \infty)</m>.
            If <m>x \in (-\infty.\ra)</m> then
            <m>x \lt \ra \lt 0</m> so that <m>ax > 1</m>,
            and hence <m>a \lt \rx \lt 0 \lt b</m>.
            If <m>x \in (\rb, \infty)</m> then
            <m>0 \lt \rb \lt x</m> so that <m>1 \lt bx</m>,
            and hence <m>a \lt 0 \lt \rx \lt b</m>.
            Thus either way we have <m>a \lt \rx = f(x) \lt b</m> so that
            <m>f(x) \in (a,b) = B</m> and <m>x \in \ivf(B)</m>.
            Hence <m>(-\infty,\ra) \cup (\rb, \infty) \ss \ivf(B)</m>,
            which completes the proof that <m>\ivf(B) = (-\infty,\ra) \cup (\rb, \infty)</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b = 0</m>.
            Then we have <m>a \lt b = 0</m>.
            An argument analogous to the previous case when
            <m>a = 0 \lt b</m> shows that <m>\ivf(B) = (-\infty, \ra)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b \lt 0</m>.
            Then we have <m>a \lt b \lt 0</m>.
            An argument analogous to the previous case when
            <m>0 \lt a \lt b</m> again shows that <m>\ivf(B) = (\rb, \ra)</m>. \end{indpar}
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in all cases and sub-cases clearly <m>\ivf(B)</m> is an open set of <m>\realsnz</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is continuous as previously discussed since
            <m>B = (a,b)</m> was an arbitrary basis element.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Regarding the subtraction function <m>-: \reals^2 \to \reals</m>,
            first define the function <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m> by <m>f(x) = -x</m>,
            which is clearly continuous by elementary calculus.
            We also know that the coordinate functions
            <m>\pi_1 : \reals^2 \to \reals</m> and <m>\pi_2: \reals^2 \to \reals</m> are also continuous.
            Therefore the composition <m>f \circ \pi_2 : \reals^2 \to \reals</m> is also continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c).
            We then have that the function <m>g: \reals^2 \to \reals^2</m> defined by
            <m>g(x \times y) = \pi_1(x \times y) \times (f \circ \pi_2)(x \times y)</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.4.
            Then the composition <m>+ \circ g : \reals^2 \to \reals</m> is continuous,
            again by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c),
            since it was shown in part<nbsp/>(a) that the addition function <m>+: \reals^2 \to \reals</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, for any <m>x \times y \in \reals^2</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>(+ \circ g)(x \times y) \amp = +(g(x \times y)) = +(\pi_1(x \times y) \times (f \circ \pi_2)(x \times y))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \pi_1(x \times y) + (f \circ \pi_2)(x \times y) = x + f(\pi_1(x \times y))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = x + f(y) = x - y</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = -(x \times y)</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>- = + \circ g</m> is continuous just as we would like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the quotient function <m>/: \reals \times (\realsnz) \to \reals</m>,
            let <m>f: \realsnz \to \reals</m> be the reciprocal function,
            which we know is continuous by part<nbsp/>(c).
            Again the coordinate functions <m>\pi_1: \reals \times (\realsnz) \to \reals</m> and
            <m>\pi_2: \reals \times (\realsnz) \to \realsnz</m> are continuous so that the composition
            <m>f \circ \pi_2: \reals \times (\realsnz) \to \reals</m> is also continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c).
            Then we have that the function <m>g: \reals \times (\realsnz) \to \reals^2</m> defined by
            <m>g(x \times y) = \pi_1(x \times y) \times (f \circ \pi_2)(x \times y)</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.4.
            Thus the composition <m>\times \circ g : \reals \times (\realsnz) \to \reals</m> is continuous again by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c) since it was shown in part<nbsp/>(b) that the multiplication function <m>\times: \reals^2 \to \reals</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, for any <m>x \times y \in \reals \times (\realsnz)</m>,
            we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>(\times \circ g)(x \times y) \amp = \times(g(x \times y)) = \times(\pi_1(x \times y) \times (f \circ \pi_2)(x \times y))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \pi_1(x \times y) \cdot (f \circ \pi_2)(x \times y) = x \cdot f(\pi_2(x \times y))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = x \cdot f(y) = x \cdot \tfrac{1}{y} = \tfrac{x}{y}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = /(x \times y)</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>/ = \times \circ g</m> is continuous as desired.

          Recall that Example<nbsp/>22.3 includes a function <m>p: \reals \to A</m> where
          <m>A = \braces{a,b,c}</m> is a three-point set.
          The function is defined by

            <mrow>p(x) = \begin{cases}a \amp  x > 0 \\ b \amp  x \lt  0 \\ c \amp  x = 0 \,. \end{cases}</mrow>

        </p>
        <p>
          We are then asked to verify that the quotient topology on <m>A</m> induced by <m>p</m> is that indicated by the following diagram:

        <proof>
          <p>
            Clearly the diagram illustrates the topology <m>\cT = \braces{\es, \braces{a}, \braces{b}, \braces{a,b}, A}</m> on <m>A</m>.
            We also note that <m>p</m> is surjective,
            and that <m>\cT</m> is the unique topology such that <m>p</m> is a quotient map.
            First, obviously <m>\es</m> and <m>A</m> must be open in the quotient topology <m>\cT</m> since it is a topology.
            Then, clearly the following sets
            <md>
              <mrow>\ivpss{a} \amp = (0, \infty)</mrow>
              <mrow>\ivpss{b} \amp = (-\infty, 0)</mrow>
              <mrow>\ivpss{a,b} \amp = (0, \infty) \cup (-\infty, 0)</mrow>
            </md>
            are all open in <m>\reals</m> so that <m>\braces{a}</m>,
            <m>\braces{b}</m>,
            and <m>\braces{a,b}</m> should be open in the quotient topology since <m>p</m> is a quotient map.
            On the contrary, the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>\ivpss{c} \amp = \zset</mrow>
              <mrow>\ivpss{a,c} \amp = \clop{0, \infty}</mrow>
              <mrow>\ivpss{b,c} \amp = \opcl{-\infty, 0}</mrow>
            </md>
            are all clearly not open in <m>\reals</m>
            (in fact they are all closed)
            so that <m>\braces{c}</m>,
            <m>\braces{a,c}</m> and <m>\braces{b,c}</m> should not be open in the quotient topology.
            As we have considered all eight of the possible subsets of <m>A</m>,
            this shows the desired result.

            So suppose that <m>V = \ivp(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
            Since we have <m>p \circ f = i_Y</m> is bijective and <m>i_Y = \inv{i_Y}</m>,
            it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>2.4 part<nbsp/>(a) that
            <md>
              <mrow>U = i_Y(U) = \inv{i_Y}(U) = \inv{(p \circ f)}(U) = \ivf(\ivp(U)) = \ivf(V) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, since <m>V</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
            we have that <m>\ivf(V) = U</m> is open in <m>Y</m> since <m>f</m> is continuous.
            This shows that <m>p</m> is a quotient map by definition.

            Suppose <m>X</m> is a topological space,
            <m>A \ss X</m>, and <m>r: X \to A</m> is a retraction.
            Let <m>f: A \to X</m> be defined by
            <m>f(a) = a</m> for all <m>a \in A</m>, i.e.
            <m>f</m> is the identity function on <m>A</m> with the range expanded to <m>X</m>.
            Now, <m>i_A</m> is continuous
            (in fact it is a homeomorphism)
            by Exercise<nbsp/>18.3 so that <m>f</m> is also continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(e) since it is just <m>i_A</m> with an expanded range.
            Then for any <m>a \in A</m> we have that

            since <m>p</m> is a retraction.
            Thus <m>p \circ f = i_A</m>,

            First, we know that <m>\pi_1</m> is continuous from &#xa7;18.
            It then follows that the restriction <m>q</m> is a continuous map as well by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(d).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now define a map <m>f: \reals \to A</m> by
            <m>f(x) = x \times 0</m> for any <m>x \in \reals</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>f(x) \in A</m>.
            We show that <m>f</m> is continuous by considering any basis element
            <m>U \times V</m> of <m>\realss</m> so that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are open in <m>\reals</m>.
            Now, if either of <m>U</m> or <m>V</m> are empty,
            then of course <m>U \times V</m> is empty as well so that
            <m>\ivf(U \times V) = \ivf(\es) = \es</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>.
            Otherwise if <m>0 \notin V</m> then also
            <m>\ivf(U \times V) = \es</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>.
            If <m>0 \in V</m> then we claim that <m>\ivf(U \times V) = U</m>,
            which is of course open in <m>\reals</m>.
            This is easy to show:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in \ivf(U \times V) \amp \bic f(x) \in U \times V</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \times 0 \in U \times V</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in U</mrow>
            </md>
            since we know that <m>0 \in V</m>.
            Thus in all cases <m>\ivf(U \times V)</m> is open in <m>\reals</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>f</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x \in \reals</m> so that we have
            <md>
              <mrow>(q \circ f)(x) = q(f(x)) = q(x \times 0) = \pi_1(x \times 0) = x \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>q \circ f = i_\reals</m>.
            Since <m>q: A \to \reals</m> and
            <m>f: \reals \to A</m> have both been shown to be continuous,
            it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>22.1 part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>q</m> is a quotient map as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>q</m> is not an open map,
            consider that subset <m>U = \clop{0, 1} \times (1,2) \ss A</m>,
            which is open in the subspace <m>A</m> since <m>U = A \cap [(-1,1) \times (1,2)]</m> and clearly
            <m>(-1,1) \times (1,2)</m> is a basis element of <m>\realss</m> and so is open.
            However, clearly the set <m>q(U) = \pi_1(U) = \clop{0,1}</m> is not open in <m>\reals</m>.
            To show that <m>q</m> is not a closed map,
            consider the set <m>C = \braces{x \times (1/x) \where x > 0}</m>.
            It is easy to see and not difficult to show that <m>C</m> is a closed subset of the subspace <m>A</m> because no point of <m>A - C</m> is a limit point of <m>C</m>.
            Also clearly <m>q(C) = \pi_1(C) = \preals</m>,
            which is not closed in <m>\reals</m> since its complement <m>\braces{x \where x \leq 0}</m> is not open.
            Thus <m>q</m> is not a closed map either.

          Then we have that <m>\peqa{} = c</m> and hence <m>x = c - y^2</m>,
          which is the equation for horizontally-oriented parabola opening to the left and shifted in <m>x</m> by <m>c</m>.
          A few of these parabolic equivalence classes are shown below for various values of <m>c</m>:

          Then, if <m>X^*</m> is the quotient space induced,
          by this equivalence relation,
          then each element of <m>X^*</m> is one of these equivalence classes.
          We claim that this space is homeomorphic to <m>\reals</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            So define <m>f: X^* \to \reals</m> as follows:
            if <m>U</m> is an equivalence class
            (so that <m>U \in X^*</m>)
            containing <m>\pptt{}</m> then set <m>f(U) = \peqa{}</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>f(U) \in \reals</m>.
            We also note that if <m>\pptt{0}</m> and
            <m>\pptt{1}</m> are both in the equivalence class <m>X</m> then
            <m>\peqa{0} = \peqa{1}</m> so that <m>f(X) = \peqa{0} = \peqa{1}</m> is well defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>U_0</m> and <m>U_1</m> are two distinct equivalence classes and that
            <m>\pptt{0} \in U_0</m> and <m>\pptt{1} \in U_1</m>.
            It then follows that it is not true that
            <m>\pptt{0} \sim \pptt{1}</m> so that <m>\peqa{0} \neq \peqa{1}</m>.
            Thus we have <m>f(U_0) = \peqa{0} \neq \peqa{1} = f(U_1)</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective.
            Next consider any real <m>c</m> and,
            the point <m>\pptz{c}</m> in the plane,
            and let <m>U</m> be the equivalence class containing <m>\pptz{c}</m>,
            which must exist since the equivalence classes form a partition of the plane.
            Then we have <m>f(U) = c + 0^2 = c</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>c</m> was arbitrary.
            This completes the proof that <m>f</m> is a bijection,
            noting that of course this means that <m>\ivf</m> is also a bijective function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the standard topology of <m>\reals</m> of course can have different bases,
            but we will concern ourselves with the order topology basis first.
            So consider any basis element
            <m>B = (a,b)</m> of <m>\reals</m> in the order topology.
            Clearly then the inverse image of <m>B</m> is the collection <m>\cU</m> of equivalence classes <m>U</m> where <m>a \lt f(U) \lt b</m>.
            Then the union of all the sets in <m>\cU</m> is the set of points in the plane <m>\pptt{}</m> where <m>a \lt \peqa{} \lt b</m>.
            An illustration of such a subset of the plane is illustrated below for <m>a = -2</m> and <m>b = 3</m>:

            It is easy to see that such a set is open in
            <m>\reals^2</m> for any <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
            which we shall not show formally.
            Thus <m>\cU</m> is an open subset of <m>X^*</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>f</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, to show that <m>\ivf</m> is continuous we utilize metric topology bases for both <m>\reals^2</m> and <m>\reals</m>,
            which we know induce the standard topologies on those sets.
            In particular,
            we use the standard metric <m>d</m> on <m>\reals</m> but use the square metric <m>\r</m> on <m>\reals^2</m>,
            which induces the standard topology on
            <m>\reals^2</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>20.3.
            Recall that the square metric is defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(\pptt{0}, \pptt{1}) = \max\braces{\abs{x_0-x_1}, \abs{y_0-y_1}} \,</mrow>

          <p>
            So consider any <m>x \in \reals</m>,
            let <m>U</m> be the equivalence class in <m>X^*</m> such that
            <m>U = \ivf(x)</m> so that <m>f(U) = x</m>,
            and let <m>\cU</m> be a neighborhood of
            <m>U = \ivf(x)</m> in the quotient topology on <m>X^*</m>.
            Then we have that <m>\cU</m> is a collection of equivalence classes and that
            <m>\pptz{x}</m> must be in <m>U</m> since <m>x + 0^2 = x = f(U)</m>.
            Clearly also the union <m>A = \bigcup_{U' \in \cU} U'</m> is then open in
            <m>\reals^2</m> since <m>\cU</m> is open in the quotient space,
            and <m>\pptz{x} \in A</m> since
            <m>\pptz{x} \in U</m> and <m>U \in \cU</m>.
            Thus by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            there is a <m>\d > 0</m> where <m>B_\r(\pptz{x}, \d) \ss A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, consider the set <m>B_d(x, \d)</m>,
            which is clearly a neighborhood of <m>x</m> in <m>\reals</m>.
            Consider any <m>V \in \ivf(B_d(x, \d))</m> and let
            <m>v = f(V)</m> so that it must be that
            <m>\pptz{v} \in V</m> since <m>v + 0^2 = v = f(V)</m>.
            Then <m>v = f(V) \in B_d(x, \d)</m> so that <m>d(v,x) = \abs{v-x} \lt  \d</m>.
            Since we have <m>\abs{v-x} \geq 0 = \abs{0-0}</m>, it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(\pptz{v}, \pptz{x}) = \max\braces{\abs{v-x}, \abs{0-0}} = \abs{v-x} \lt  \d \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and hence <m>\pptz{v} \in B_\r(\pptz{x}, \d) \ss A = \bigcup_{U' \in \cU} U'</m>.
            Therefore there is an equivalence class <m>W</m> in <m>\cU</m> such that
            <m>\pptz{v} \in W</m> and <m>W \in \cU</m>.
            However, since the equivalence classes are all disjoint,
            it has to be that <m>W = V</m> since <m>\pptz{v} \in V</m> as well.
            Thus <m>V = W \in \cU</m> so that
            <m>\ivf(B_d(x,\d)) \ss \cU</m> since <m>V</m> was arbitrary.
            This suffices to show that <m>\ivf</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>\cU</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>U = \ivf(x)</m>.
            This completes the proof that <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism so that <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to <m>\reals</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) Here two points are in the same equivalence class if <m>\peqb{}</m> have the same value,
          say <m>c</m>.
          Then we have that the equivalence class is all the points in the plane such that <m>\peqb{} = c</m>,
          which is clearly a circle in the plane with radius
          <m>\sqrt{c}</m> centered at the origin,
          noting that of course always <m>c = \peqb{} \geq 0</m>.
          We also note that the only point such that
          <m>\peqb{} = 0</m> is <m>\pptz{0}</m> itself,
          so this the only point in its equivalence class.
          We claim that the quotient topology on the set of equivalence classes <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to the subspace topology of nonnegative reals,
          i.e. the subspace <m>A = \braces{x \in \reals \where x \geq 0}</m> of <m>\reals</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Taking a similar approach to that in part<nbsp/>(a),
            define <m>f: X^* \to A</m> by
            <m>f(U) = \norm{\pptt{}} = \sqrt{\peqb{}}</m> if <m>\pptt{}</m> is a point in the equivalence class <m>U</m>.
            Clearly we have <m>f(U) \geq 0</m> so that <m>f(U) \in A</m>.
            It also follows that <m>f</m> is well-defined since,
            if <m>\pptt{0}</m> and <m>\pptt{1}</m> are two points in the same equivalence class <m>U</m>,
            then <m>f(U) = \sqrt{\peqb{0}} = \sqrt{\peqb{1}}</m> since <m>\peqb{0} = \peqb{1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, if <m>U_0</m> and <m>U_1</m> are two distinct equivalence classes and <m>\pptt{0} \in U_0</m> and
            <m>\pptt{1} \in U_1</m> then it is not true that
            <m>\pptt{0} \sim \pptt{1}</m> so that <m>f(U_0) = \sqrt{\peqb{0}} \neq \sqrt{\peqb{1}} = f(U_1)</m> since
            <m>\peqb{0} \neq \peqb{1}</m> and the square root function is injective on the nonnegative reals.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is injective.
            Also, if <m>c</m> is any element of <m>A</m> then let <m>U</m> be the equivalence class containing <m>\pptz{c}</m>,
            which exists since the classes form a partition on the plane.
            Then we have <m>f(U) = \sqrt{c^2 + 0^2} = \abs{c} = c</m> since <m>c \geq 0</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>c</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence <m>f</m> is a bijection so that of course <m>\ivf</m> is also a bijective function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, consider the order topology basis of <m>\reals</m> and any corresponding basis element <m>B</m> of the subspace <m>A</m>.
            Then clearly either <m>B = \clop{0, b}</m> (since then,
            for example,
            <m>B = A \cap (-1,b)</m> and <m>(-1,b)</m> is clearly a basis element of <m>\reals</m>) or
            <m>B = (a,b)</m> for some <m>0 \leq a \lt b</m>.
            In the former case clearly <m>\ivf(B)</m> is the collection <m>\cU</m> of equivalence classes <m>U</m> such that <m>0 \leq f(U) \lt b</m>,
            the union of which is clearly the set of points <m>\pptt{}</m> in the plane such that <m>\sqrt{\peqb{}} \lt b</m>,
            which is an open filled circle of radius <m>b</m> centered at the origin.
            This is obviously an open set of <m>\reals^2</m>.
            In the later case clearly <m>\ivf(B)</m> is the collection <m>\cU</m> of equivalence classes <m>U</m> such that <m>a \lt f(U) \lt b</m>,
            the union of which is the set of points in the plane <m>\pptt{}</m> such that <m>a \lt \sqrt{\peqb{}} \lt b</m>.
            As this is clearly an open annular ring centered at the origin,
            it is open in <m>\reals^2</m>.
            Hence in either case the union of the collection <m>\cU</m> is open in <m>\reals^2</m> so that
            <m>\cU = \ivf(B)</m> is an open subset of <m>X^*</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary basis element of <m>A</m>,
            this shows that <m>f</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to what was done in part<nbsp/>(a),
            we show that <m>\ivf</m> is also continuous by utilizing the euclidean metric <m>d</m> on
            <m>\reals^2</m> and the standard metric <m>d'</m> on <m>A</m>, i.e.
            <m>d'</m> is the standard metric <m>d</m> on <m>\reals</m> restricted to <m>A \times A</m>,
            which is a metric for the subspace <m>A</m> by the remarks at the beginning of &#xa7;21.
            So consider any <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>x \geq 0</m>,
            let <m>U</m> be the equivalence class in <m>X^*</m> such that
            <m>U = \ivf(x)</m> so that <m>f(U) = x</m>,
            and let <m>\cU</m> be a neighborhood of
            <m>U = \ivf(x)</m> in the quotient topology on <m>X^*</m>.
            Then we have that <m>\cU</m> is a collection of equivalence classes and that
            <m>\pptz{x}</m> must be in <m>U</m> since <m>\sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = \abs{x} = x = f(U)</m>.
            Clearly also the union <m>C = \bigcup_{U' \in \cU} U'</m> is then open in
            <m>\reals^2</m> since <m>\cU</m> is open in the quotient space,
            and <m>\pptz{x} \in C</m> since
            <m>\pptz{x} \in U</m> and <m>U \in \cU</m>.
            Thus by <xref ref="lem_metric_ball">Lemma</xref>
            there is a <m>\d > 0</m> where <m>B_d(\pptz{x}, \d) \ss C</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, consider the set <m>B_{d'}(x, \d)</m>,
            which is clearly a neighborhood of <m>x</m> in <m>A</m>.
            Consider any <m>V \in \ivf(B_{d'}(x, \d))</m> and let
            <m>v = f(V) \in A</m> so that it must be that
            <m>\pptz{v} \in V</m> since <m>\sqrt{v^2 + 0^2} = \abs{v} = v = f(V)</m>.
            Then <m>v = f(V) \in B_{d'}(x, \d)</m> so that <m>d'(v,x) = d(v,x) = \abs{v-x} \lt  \d</m>.
            Then also
            <md>
              <mrow>d(\pptz{v}, \pptz{x}) = \sqrt{(z-x)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{(z-x)^2} = \abs{v-x} \lt  \d \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            and hence <m>\pptz{v} \in B_d(\pptz{x}, \d) \ss C = \bigcup_{U' \in \cU} U'</m>.
            Therefore there is an equivalence class <m>W</m> in <m>\cU</m> such that
            <m>\pptz{v} \in W</m> and <m>W \in \cU</m>.
            However, since the equivalence classes are all disjoint,
            it has to be that <m>W = V</m> since <m>\pptz{v} \in V</m> as well.
            Thus <m>V = W \in \cU</m> so that
            <m>\ivf(B_{d'}(x,\d)) \ss \cU</m> since <m>V</m> was arbitrary.
            This suffices to show that <m>\ivf</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 since <m>\cU</m> was an arbitrary neighborhood of <m>U = \ivf(x)</m>.
            This completes the proof that <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism so that <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to <m>A</m> as desired.

        <p>
          It is easy to see and trivial to show that <m>Y</m> is a partition of <m>\reals_K</m>,
          and that <m>K</m> becomes a single point in the quotient space <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, consider a single point <m>U</m> in the collection <m>Y</m>.
            If <m>U = K</m> then clearly <m>\ivpss{U} = K</m>,
            which we know is closed in
            <m>\reals_K</m> as was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>17.16 part<nbsp/>(b).
            If <m>U \neq K</m> then <m>U = \braces{x}</m> for some <m>x \in \reals - K</m> so that of course
            <m>\ivpss{U} = \braces{x}</m> is closed in <m>\reals_K</m> since
            <m>\reals_K</m> was shown to satisfy the <m>T_1</m> axiom,
            again in Exercise<nbsp/>17.16 part<nbsp/>(b).
            Hence either way <m>\ivpss{U}</m> is closed in <m>\reals_K</m> so that
            <m>\braces{U}</m> must be closed in <m>Y</m> since <m>p</m> is a quotient map.
            This suffices to show that <m>Y</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom since <m>U</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>Y</m> is <em>not</em>
            Hausdorff consider any neighborhood <m>V_0</m> in <m>Y</m> of the point <m>\zset</m> and any neighborhood <m>V_K</m> in <m>Y</m> of the point <m>K</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>\zset</m> and <m>K</m> are distinct points in <m>Y</m>.
            Then set <m>U_K = \ivp(V_K) = \bigcup_{V \in V_K} V</m> so that
            <m>K \ss U_K</m> since <m>K \in V_K</m>.
            Similarly, set <m>U_0 = \ivp(V_0) = \bigcup_{V \in V_0} V</m> so that
            <m>\zset \ss U_0</m> since <m>\zset \in V_0</m>,
            and hence <m>0 \in U_0</m>.
            Since <m>V_0</m> is open in <m>Y</m>,
            it follows that <m>U_0 = \ivp(V_0)</m> must be open in
            <m>\reals_K</m> since <m>p</m> is a quotient map.
            It then follows that there is a basis element <m>B_0</m> in
            <m>\reals_K</m> such that <m>0 \in B_0 \ss U_0</m>.
            Hence <m>B_0 = (a,b)</m> or
            <m>B_0 = (a,b)-K</m> for some <m>a \lt 0 \lt b</m>.
            Now, since we have <m>0 \lt b</m>,
            clearly there is an <m>n \in \pints</m> large enough that <m>0 \lt 1/n \lt b</m>,
            and by definition <m>1/n \in K \ss U_K</m>.
            Then, since <m>U_K</m> is open in <m>\reals_K</m>,
            there must be a basis element <m>B_K</m> of
            <m>\reals_K</m> such that <m>1/n \in B_K \ss U_K</m>.
            Then it must be that <m>B_K = (c,d)</m> for some
            <m>c \lt 1/n \lt d</m> since <m>1/n \in K</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, set <m>e = \max\braces{1/(n+1),
            c}</m> and <m>x = (e + 1/n)/2</m>.
            Then we then have that <m>1/(n+1) \leq e \lt x \lt 1/n</m> so that <m>x \notin K</m>.
            We also have <m>a \lt 0 \lt 1/(n+1) \leq e \lt x \lt 1/n \lt b</m> so that
            <m>x \in B_0 \ss U_0</m> regardless of whether or not <m>K</m> is included in <m>B_0</m> or not.
            Lastly, we have that <m>c \leq e \lt x \lt 1/n \lt d</m> so that <m>x \in (c,d) = B_K \ss U_K</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in U_0</m> and <m>x \notin K</m> so that
            <m>p(x) = \braces{x} \in V_0</m> since <m>U_0 = \ivp(V_0)</m>.
            Likewise we have <m>x \in U_K</m> and
            <m>U_K = \ivp(V_K)</m> so that <m>p(x) = \braces{x} \in V_K</m> as well.
            Hence <m>\braces{x} = p(x) \in V_0 \cap V_K</m> so that these neighborhoods intersect.
            Since <m>V_0</m> and <m>V_K</m> were arbitrary neighborhoods of <m>\zset</m> and <m>K</m>,
            respectively,
            in <m>Y</m>, this shows that <m>Y</m> fails to be Hausdorff.

        <p>
          (b) In what follows we define the map <m>p \times p : \reals_K \times \reals_K \to Y \times Y</m> by
          <md>
            <mrow>(p \times p)(\pptt{}) = p(x) \times p(y)</mrow>
          </md>
          for <m>\pptt{} \in \reals_K \times \reals_K</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Define the set <m>\D_Y = \braces{(U,U) \where U \in Y} \ss Y \times Y</m> to be the diagonal of <m>Y \times Y</m>.
            Since it was shown in part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>Y</m> is not Hausdorff,
            it follows that <m>\D_Y</m> is not closed in
            <m>Y \times Y</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>17.13.
            Now set <m>\D = \inv{(p \times p)}(\D_Y) \ss \reals_K \times \reals_K</m>,
            and we claim that <m>\D = \D_\reals \cup (K \times K)</m>,
            where of course <m>\D_\reals = \braces{(x,x) \where x \in \reals}</m> is the diagonal of <m>\reals_K</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show this, first consider
            <m>x \times y \in \D = \inv{(p \times p)}(\D_Y)</m> so that <m>(p \times p)(x \times y) = p(x) \times p(y) \in D_Y</m>.
            Hence <m>p(x) = p(y) \in Y</m> so that either
            <m>x,y \in K</m> so that <m>p(x) = K = p(y)</m>,
            or <m>x,y \notin K</m> so that <m>p(x) = \braces{x} = \braces{y} = p(y)</m> and <m>x = y</m>.
            Clearly in the former case we have <m>x \times y \in K \times K</m>,
            and in the latter case <m>x \times y = x \times x \in \D_\reals</m>.
            Thus either way we have <m>x \times y \in \D_\reals \cup (K \times K)</m> so that <m>\D \ss \D_\reals \cup (K \times K)</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x \times y \in \D_\reals \cup (K \times K)</m>.
            If <m>x \times y \in \D_\reals</m> then <m>x = y</m> so that of course
            <m>p(x) = p(y)</m> since <m>p</m> is a function.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>x \times y \in K \times K</m> then we again have <m>p(x) = K = p(y)</m>.
            Therefore either way we have
            <m>p(x) = p(y)</m> so that <m>(p \times p)(x \times y) = p(x) \times p(y) = p(x) \times p(x) \in \D_Y</m>,
            and thus <m>x \times y \in \inv{(p \times p)}(\D_Y) = \D</m>.
            Hence <m>\D \sps \D_\reals \cup (K \times K)</m> as well so that equality has been shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, since <m>\reals_K</m> is Hausdorff (again,
            as shown in Exercise<nbsp/>17.16),
            it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>17.13 that
            <m>\D_\reals</m> is closed in <m>\reals_K \times \reals_K</m>,
            and therefore <m>\closure{\D_\reals} = \D_\reals</m>.
            Since <m>K</m> is also closed in <m>\reals_K</m>
            (also shown in Exercise<nbsp/>17.16),
            we have that <m>K \times K</m> is closed in

            which shows that <m>\D = \inv{(p \times p)}(\D_Y)</m> is in fact closed in <m>\reals_K \times \reals_K</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>p \times p</m> is <em>not</em>

    <title>Supplementary Exercises: Topological Groups</title>
    <p>
      For this section,
      recall that a group is a set <m>G</m> together with some operation <m>\cdot</m> that satisfies the following properties,
      called the group axioms: \begin{enumerate} It is easy to show directly from these axioms that the identity element of a group is unique,
      and so we refer to <em>the</em>
      identity element. \end{enumerate} Similarly, if <m>a \in G</m>,
      then its inverse element is also unique,
      and is usually denoted by <m>\inv{a}</m>.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <title>1</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> denote a group that is also a topological space satisfying the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
        Show that <m>H</m> is a topological group if and only if the map of
        <m>H \times H</m> into <m>H</m> sending
        <m>x \times y</m> to <m>x \cdot \inv{y}</m> is continuous.

        <lemma xml:id="lem_setg_idinv">
          <statement>
            <p>
              In any group <m>G</m> the inverse element of an inverse element is the element itself, i.e.
              <m>\inv{\parens{\inv{x}}} = x</m> for any <m>x \in G</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x</m> in the group <m>G</m> with operation <m>\cdot</m> and identity element <m>e</m>,
            and let <m>y = \inv{\parens{\inv{x}}}</m>.
            Then we have of course that
            <m>y \cdot \inv{x} = e</m> since <m>y</m> is the inverse of <m>\inv{x}</m>.
            Since we of course also have
            <m>x \cdot \inv{x} = e</m> since <m>\inv{x}</m> is the inverse of <m>x</m>,
            it has to be that <m>y = x</m> because the inverse of <m>\inv{x}</m> must be unique.
            Therefore of course <m>\inv{\parens{\inv{x}}} = y = x</m> as desired.

          <em>Main Problem.</em>
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> First suppose that <m>H</m> is a topological group.
            Then <m>f: H \to H</m> defined by <m>f(x) = \inv{x}</m> and
            <m>g: H \times H \to H</m> defined by <m>g(\pptt{}) = x \cdot y</m> are both continuous.
            Define <m>h: H \times H \to H</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>h = g \circ (i_H \times f) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where of course <m>i_H</m> is the identity function on <m>H</m>,
            and we have defined the function
            <m>i_H \times f : H \times H \to H \times H</m> as in Exercise<nbsp/>18.10.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we know that both <m>i_H</m> and <m>f</m> are continuous so that
            <m>i_H \times f</m> is continuous by Exercise<nbsp/>18.10.
            It then follows that <m>g \circ (i_H \times f) = h</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c) since <m>g</m> is also continuous.
            Now, for any <m>\pptt{} \in H \times H</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(\pptt{}) \amp = \parens{g \circ (i_H \times f)}(\pptt{})</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = g((i_H \times f)(\pptt{}))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = g(i_H(x) \times f(y))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = g(x \times \inv{y})</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = x \cdot \inv{y} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we have shown that <m>h</m> is continuous,
            this shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now again define
            <m>h: H \times H \to H</m> by <m>h(\pptt{}) = x \cdot \inv{y}</m>,
            and suppose that <m>h</m> is continuous.
            Then <m>h</m> is continuous in each variable separately by Exercise<nbsp/>18.11.
            So, if we let <m>e</m> be the unique identity element of <m>H</m>,
            then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(e \times x) = e \cdot \inv{x} = \inv{x}</mrow>
            </md>
            is continuous for any <m>x</m>.
            Similarly, for any <m>x,y \in H</m>,
            we have that <m>\inv{\parens{\inv{y}}} = y</m> by <xref ref="lem_setg_idinv">Lemma</xref> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x \times \inv{y}) = x \cdot \inv{\parens{\inv{y}}} = x \cdot y</mrow>
            </md>
            must also be continuous.

            This shows by definition that <m>C</m> is closed.

            It suffices to show that the subset of

            since clearly any other subset is the union of such single-element open subsets and is therefore also open by the definition of a topology.
            So consider any <m>(x,y) \in X \times Y</m> and the subset <m>\braces{(x,y)} \ss X \times Y</m>.
            Then clearly <m>\braces{(x, y)} = \braces{x} \times \braces{y}</m>,
            which is a basis element of

          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we must show that <m>(\ints, +)</m> is even a group.
            Clearly <m>a+b</m> is an integer when <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are so that the closure axiom is satisfied.
            Also, we know that integer addition is associative.
            We clearly have that <m>0 \in \ints</m> and that <m>a + 0 = a</m> for any
            <m>a \in \ints</m> so that <m>0</m> is the identity element of <m>(\ints, +)</m>.
            Lastly, for any <m>a \in \ints</m>,
            we have that <m>-a \in \ints</m> and that
            <m>a + (-a) = a - a = 0</m> so that clearly <m>-a</m> is the inverse of <m>a</m>.
            This shows that <m>(\ints, +)</m> is in fact a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is a topological group,
            we first note that <m>\ints</m> clearly has the discrete topology when considered both an order topology or as a subspace of <m>\reals</m>,
            for similar reason as discussed in Example<nbsp/>3 of &#xa7;14.
            Thus <m>\ints</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom by <xref ref="lem_setg_t1disc">Lemma</xref> since it is discrete.
            Also <m>X \times X</m> is the discrete topology by <xref ref="lem_setg_pdisc">Lemma</xref>.
            Thus the function <m>f</m> defined by
            <m>f(x \times y) = x + \inv{y} = x + (-y) = x - y</m> is a function from <m>X \times X</m> to <m>X</m>,
            so that it follows that <m>f</m> is continuous by <xref ref="lem_setg_cdisc">Lemma</xref>
            since <m>X \times X</m> is discrete.
            Hence <m>(\ints, +)</m> is a topological group by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Similarly to part<nbsp/>(a),
            clearly <m>(\reals,+)</m> is a group with identity element <m>0</m> and inverse element <m>-x</m> for any <m>x \in \reals</m>.
            However, this time the topology is no longer discrete.
            Of course we know that <m>\reals</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
            Now consider the function <m>f(\pptt{}) = x + \inv{y} = x + (-y) = x - y</m> for any <m>x,y \in \reals</m>.
            Consider also any basis element <m>B = (a,b) \in \reals</m>,
            where here we are of course using the order topology basis.
            Then we clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>\ivf(B) \amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where f(\pptt{}) \in (a,b)} = \braces{\pptt{} \where a \lt  f(\pptt{}) \lt  b}</mrow>

              <mrow>\amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where x-a > y > x-b} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly this is the region in
            <m>\reals^2</m> between the lines <m>y=x-b</m> and <m>y=x-a</m>,
            which is obviously an open set in <m>\reals^2</m>.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is continuous since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary basis element,
            so that <m>(\reals,+)</m> is a topological group by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly <m>\realsp</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom since <m>\reals</m> does.
            Next we note that for any <m>x,y \in \realsp</m> we have that
            <m>x \cdot y</m> is also positive so that <m>x \cdot y \in \realsp</m> as well,
            which shows the closure property of a group.
            Also, clearly <m>1 \in \realsp</m> is the identity element of multiplication,
            and the inverse element is
            <m>\inv{x} = 1/x</m> for any <m>x \in \realsp</m>,
            noting that this is defined since <m>x > 0</m>,
            and that <m>1/x > 0</m> so that <m>\inv{x} = 1/x \in \realsp</m>.
            Lastly, we know that multiplication is associative on the reals
            (and therefore also on <m>\realsp</m>),
            which completes the check that <m>(\realsp,\cdot)</m> is in fact a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            As before, define the function
            <m>f: \realsp \times \realsp \to \realsp</m> by <m>f(\pptt{}) = x \cdot \inv{y} = x \cdot 1/y = x/y</m>.
            Consider the order topology basis of <m>\reals</m> and consider any basis element <m>B</m> of the subspace <m>\realsp</m> so that <m>B = \realsp \cap (a,b)</m> for some
            <m>a,b \in \reals</m> where <m>a\lt b</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>16.1.
            Now, if <m>a \leq 0</m> then clearly <m>B = (0, b)</m>,
            and we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\ivf(B) \amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where f(\pptt{}) \in B} = \braces{\pptt{} \where 0 \lt  f(\pptt{}) \lt  b}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where 0 \lt  x/y \lt  b} = \braces{\pptt{} \where 0 \lt  x \lt  by}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where 0 \lt  x/b \lt  y} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            noting that <m>0 \lt  b</m> so that <m>x/b</m> is defined.
            Obviously this is the region in
            <m>\realsp \times \realsp</m> (<m>\realsp \times \realsp</m> being the upper right quadrant of
            <m>\reals^2</m> that does not include either axis) above the line <m>y = x/b</m>,
            which is easy to show is open in <m>\realsp \times \realsp</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if <m>a > 0</m> than <m>B = (a,b)</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>\ivf(B) \amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where f(\pptt{}) \in B} = \braces{\pptt{} \where a \lt  f(\pptt{}) \lt  b}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where a \lt  x/y \lt  b} = \braces{\pptt{} \where ay \lt  x \lt  by}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where ay \lt  x \land x \lt  by} = \braces{\pptt{} \where y \lt  x/a \land x/b \lt  y}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \braces{\pptt{} \where x/b \lt  y \lt  x/a} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is clearly the region of
            <m>\realsp \times \realsp</m> between the lines <m>y = x/b</m> and <m>y = x/a</m>.
            It is easy to see that again this is an open subset of <m>\realsp \times \realsp</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is continuous either way.
            This in turn proves that <m>(\realsp,\cdot)</m> is a topological space,
            again by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1.

          <p>
            Topologies on the complex plane <m>\cpx</m> have not really been discussed,
            but <m>\cpx</m> is usually defined as
            <m>\reals \times \reals</m> having the usual product topology.
            Then of course <m>S^1</m> is the unit circle in <m>\cpx</m>.
            We know that <m>\reals</m> is Hausdorff so that
            <m>\cpx = \reals \times \reals</m> is as well by Theorem<nbsp/>17.11.
            Then, again by Theorem<nbsp/>17.11,
            <m>S^1</m> is Hausdorff since it is a subspace of <m>\cpx</m>,
            and so it also satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
          </p>
          <p>
            While perhaps not immediately obvious,
            it is easy to show that <m>S^1</m> is closed under multiplication.
            If <m>z,w \in S^1</m> then <m>\abs{z} = \abs{w} = 1</m> so that
            <m>\abs{z \cdot w} = \abs{z} \cdot \abs{w} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1</m> by familiar rules of complex analysis so that <m>z \cdot w \in S^1</m> as well.
            Clearly <m>1 \in S^1</m> is the identity element where the inverse element of <m>z \in S^1</m> is <m>1/z</m>,
            noting that <m>\abs{1/z} = 1/\abs{z} = 1/1 = 1</m> since <m>z \in S^1</m>,
            and so <m>1/z \in S^1</m>.
            We also note that <m>\abs{0} = 0</m>,
            and hence <m>0 \notin S^1</m> so that the inverse <m>1/z</m> is always defined.
            Lastly, we know that multiplication is associative within <m>\cpx</m> and therefore also within <m>S^1</m>.
            This shows that <m>(S^1,\cdot)</m> satisfies all of the group axioms.
          </p>
          <p>
            To rigorously show that <m>S^1</m> is a topological group is actually quite tedious so we shall omit some details.
            Suppose that <m>U</m> is open in <m>S^1</m> and that
            <m>z \times w \in \ivf(U)</m> so that <m>f(z \times w) \in U</m>.
            Now, clearly the unit circle in <m>\cpx = \reals \times \reals</m> is the set
            <m>S^1 = \braces{e^{i\th} \where \th \in \reals}</m> so that we can express <m>z = e^{i\th}</m> and
            <m>w = e^{i\phi}</m> for some <m>\th,\phi \in \reals</m>.
            We then have that
            <md>
              <mrow>f(z \times w) = z/w = e^{i\th}/e^{i\phi} = e^{i\th}e^{-i\phi} = e^{i(\th-\phi)} \in U \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While tedious to show rigorously,
            it follows from the fact that <m>U</m> is open in <m>S^1</m> that there is an <m>\e > 0</m> where <m>f(z \times w) \in A_{\th-\phi,\e} \ss U</m>,
            where we define
            <md>
              <mrow>A_{\a,\e} = \braces{e^{i\g} \where \a-\e \lt  \g \lt  \a+\e} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            noting that of course <m>A_{\a,\e} \ss S^1</m>.
            Now consider <m>A_{\th,\e/2}</m> and <m>A_{\phi,\e/2}</m>,
            which are both clearly open in <m>S^1</m> and noting that clearly
            <m>z \in A_{\th,\e/2}</m> and <m>w \in A_{\phi,\e/2}</m>.
            For any <m>z' = e^{i\th'} \in A_{\th,\e/2}</m> and <m>w' = e^{i\phi'} \in A_{\phi,\e/2}</m> we then have that
            <md>
              <mrow>\th - \e/2 \amp \lt  \th' \lt  \th + \e/2 \amp \phi - \e/2 \amp \lt  \phi' \lt  \phi + \e/2 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence
            <md>
              <mrow>-\phi + \e/2 > -\phi'> -\phi - \e/2</mrow>
              <mrow>\th' - \phi + \e/2 > \th' - \phi'> \th' -\phi - \e/2</mrow>
              <mrow>\th + \e/2 - \phi + \e/2 > \th' - \phi + \e/2 > \th' - \phi'>  \th' -\phi - \e/2 > \th - \e/2 -\phi - \e/2</mrow>
              <mrow>(\th - \phi) + \e > \th' - \phi'> (\th - \phi) - \e</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>f(z' \times w') = e^{i(\th' - \phi')} \in A_{\th-\phi,\e} \ss U</m>.
            Thus <m>z' \times w' \in \ivf(U)</m> so that
            <m>z \times w \in A_{\th,\e/2} \times  A_{\phi,\e/2} \ss \ivf(U)</m> since <m>z'</m> and <m>w'</m> were arbitrary.
            We also have that <m>A_{\th,\e/2} \times  A_{\phi,\e/2}</m> is open in
            <m>S^1 \times S^1</m> since both <m>A_{\th,\e/2}</m> and
            <m>A_{\phi,\e/2}</m> are open in <m>S^1</m>.
            Since <m>z \times w</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>\ivf(U)</m>,
            this shows that <m>\ivf(U)</m> is open in <m>S^1 \times S^1</m>,
            which in turn shows that <m>f</m> is continuous by definition.
            Thus by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1 we have that <m>S^1</m> is a topological group.

        <p>
          (e)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, from linear algebra we know that the matrix product of two nonsingular <m>n</m> by <m>n</m> matrices is another nonsingular <m>n</m> by <m>n</m> matrix,
            so that <m>\gl(n)</m> is closed under matrix multiplication.
            Clearly the identity matrix is the identity element of <m>\gl(n)</m>,
            while the inverse matrix <m>\inv{A}</m> is the inverse element of the matrix <m>A \in \gl(n)</m>,
            noting that this inverse matrix exists since <m>A</m> is nonsingular.
            Lastly, we know that matrix multiplication is associative,
            which suffices to show that <m>(\gl(n), \cdot)</m> is a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is a topological group takes more work.
            To begin, we note that of course
            <m>\reals^{n^2}</m> is Hausdorff and so satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom.
            Thus so does <m>\gl(n)</m> since
            <m>\reals^{n^2}</m> gives it its topology.
            Next, we denote a vector in
            <m>\reals^n</m> by <m>\vx_n = \cpfin{x}{n}</m>,
            using the subscript on the vector itself to indicate its dimension.
            We show that the function <m>s_n: \reals^n \to \reals</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>s_n(\vx_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i</mrow>
            </md>
            is continuous for all <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            which we show by induction.
            First, for <m>n = 1</m>,
            we clearly have that <m>s_n</m> is simply the identity function from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\reals</m>,
            which is clearly continuous.
            Now suppose that <m>s_n</m> is continuous.
            Define <m>g : \reals^{n+1} \to \reals^n</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>g(\vx_{n+1}) = \pi_1(\vx_{n+1}) \times \cdots \times \pi_n(\vx_{n+1}) = \cpfin{x}{n} = \vx_n \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 since we know that each <m>\pi_i</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then also <m>s_n \circ g</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c).
            It then follows that the function <m>h : \reals^{n+1} \to \reals^2</m> defined by
            <m>h(\vx_{n+1}) = (s_n \circ g)(\vx_{n+1}) \times \pi_{n+1}(\vx_{n+1})</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.4 since both
            <m>s_n \circ g</m> and <m>\pi_{n+1}</m> are continuous.
            Lastly we then have that <m>k : \reals^{n+1} \to \reals</m> defined by
            <m>+ \circ h</m> is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c),
            where of course <m>+</m> is the usual addition operation from <m>\reals^2</m> to <m>\reals</m>,
            which we showed is continuous in Exercise<nbsp/>21.12.
            Now we claim that <m>k = s_{n+1}</m>.
            For any <m>\vx_{n+1} \in \reals^{n+1}</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>k(\vx_{n+1}) \amp = (+ \circ h)(\vx_{n+1}) = +(h(\vx_{n+1})) = +((s_n \circ g)(\vx_{n+1}) \times \pi_{n+1}(\vx_{n+1}))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = +(s_n(g(\vx_{n+1})), x_{n+1}) = +(s_n(\vx_n), x_{n+1}) = s_n(\vx_n) + x_{n+1}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + x_{n+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = s_{n+1}(\vx_{n+1}) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the induction since we have shown that <m>k = s_{n+1}</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that the function
            <m>p_{ij} : \reals^n \times \reals^n \to \reals</m> defined by <m>p_{ij}(\vx_n \times \vy_n) = x_i y_j</m> is continuous,
            where of course <m>ij \in \intsfin{n}</m>.
            Define the function <m>g_{ij}: \reals^n \times \reals^n \to \reals^2</m> by
            <m>g_{ij} = \pi_i \times \pi_j</m> as in Exercise<nbsp/>18.10,
            which we know is continuous by that exercise since the coordinate functions are continuous.
            Then the function <m>\cdot \circ g_{ij}</m> from
            <m>\reals^n \times \reals^n</m> to <m>\reals</m> is also continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c),
            where of course <m>\cdot</m> is the normal multiplication operation from <m>\reals^2</m> to <m>\reals</m>,
            which we know is continuous from Exercise<nbsp/>12.12.
            However, for any <m>\vx_n,\vy_n \in \reals^n</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>(\cdot \circ g_{ij})(\vx_n \times \vy_n) = \cdot(g_{ij}(\vx_n \times \vy_n)) = \cdot(\pi_i(\vx_n) \times \pi_j(\vy_n)) = \cdot(x_i \times y_j) = x_i \cdot y_j = p_{ij}(\vx_n \times \vy_n)</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>\cdot \circ g_{ij} = p_{ij}</m> is continuous,
            which shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, by definition,
            each matrix component of the resultant matrix in matrix multiplication on <m>\gl(n)</m> is a sum of products,
            where each product involves a term from each of the matrices,
            and the sum has <m>n</m> terms going across a row of the first matrix and a column of the second.
            Thus each component is a composition of the sum function
            <m>s_n : \reals^n \to \reals</m> with a mapping <m>f</m> from <m>\reals^{n^2} \times \reals^{n^2} \to \reals^n</m>,
            where each element in <m>\reals^n</m> of this mapping is a product function <m>p_{ij}</m>.
            Since have shown above that each <m>p_{ij}</m> is continuous,
            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 that the mapping <m>f</m> is also continuous.
            Hence the composition <m>s_n \circ f</m>,
            i.e. the matrix component function,
            is also continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c) since we have also shown above that <m>s_n</m> is continuous.
            Since each component function is continuous,
            it again follows from Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 that the overall matrix multiplication mapping from <m>\reals^{n^2} \times \reals^{n^2} \to \reals^{n^2}</m> is continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the inverse element function,
            we recall from linear algebra that in the inverse of a matrix <m>A \in \gl(n)</m> is
            <md>
              <mrow>\inv{A} = \frac{1}{\abs{A}} \adj(A) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where <m>\adj(A)</m> is the adjugate matrix of <m>A</m> and <m>\abs{A}</m> is the determinant of <m>A</m>,
            noting that this is nonzero since <m>A</m> is nonsingular.
            Now, the determinant is a sum of products so that the function <m>g: \gl(N) \to \reals</m> defined by
            <m>g(A) = \abs{A}</m> is continuous by the same arguments as above for matrix multiplication.
            Likewise each element of the adjugate matrix is a sum of products as well so that the function
            <m>f_{ij} : \gl(A) \to \reals</m> defined by <m>f_{ij}(A) = \adj(A)_{ij}</m>,
            i.e. the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column component of the adjugate matrix,
            is also continuous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then clearly the corresponding component of the inverse matrix is the function
            <m>h_{ij} : \gl(A) \to \reals</m> defined by <m>h_{ij}(A) = f_{ij}(A)/g(A)</m>.
            Since both <m>f_{ij}</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous
            (and again noting that <m>g</m> is always nonzero),
            then their quotient <m>h_{ij}</m> is also continuous by Exercise<nbsp/>21.12.
            Hence, since each component <m>h_{ij}</m> of the inverse matrix is continuous,
            it follows that the inversion operation as a whole is continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>19.6 as above,
            considering the matrices as elements of <m>\reals^{n^2}</m>.
            Since both multiplication and inversion are continuous,
            this shows that <m>\gl(n)</m> is a topological group by definition.

            We first show that <m>\clH</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
            noting that of course <m>\clH</m> is nonempty since <m>H</m> must be
            (as it is a subgroup)
            and <m>H \ss \clH</m>.
            Let <m>f : G \times G \to G</m> be the operation defined by
            <m>f(\pptt{}) = x \cdot \inv{y}</m> for <m>x,y \in G</m>.
            It is a well known theorem of group theory that <m>\clH</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> if and only if
            <m>x \cdot \inv{y} \in \clH</m> for any <m>x,y \in \clH</m>,
            which is to say that <m>f(\clH \times \clH) \ss \clH</m>.
            This is exactly what we intend to show.
            We have the following deductions:

              <li>

                  <m>x \cdot \inv{y} \in H</m> for every <m>x,y \in H</m>,
                  which is to say that <m>f(H \times H) \ss H</m>.
                  It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>17.6 part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>\closure{f(H \times H)} \ss \clH</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Putting these all together, we can conclude that
            <md>
              <mrow>f(\clH \times \clH) = f(\closure{H \times H}) \ss \closure{f(H \times H)} \ss \clH \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows the desired result that <m>\clH</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, obviously <m>H</m> and <m>\clH</m> are both groups by the definition of a subgroup.
            The operation of <m>H</m>
            (or <m>\clH</m>)
            is of course the operation of <m>G</m> with its domain restricted to <m>H \times H</m>
            (or <m>\clH \times \clH</m>).
            The continuity of this operation on <m>H</m>
            (or <m>\clH</m>)
            follows from Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(d) since it is continuous on <m>G</m> since <m>G</m> is a topological group.
            Likewise the inversion function on <m>H</m>
            (or <m>\clH</m>)
            is a restriction of the inversion function on <m>G</m>,
            and so is also continuous for the same reason.
            Hence <m>H</m> and <m>\clH</m> are topological groups by definition.

          are homeomorphisms of <m>G</m>.
          Conclude that <m>G</m> is a <em>homogeneous space</em>.
          (This means that for every pair <m>x</m>,
          <m>y</m> of points of <m>G</m>,
          there exists a homeomorphism of <m>G</m> onto itself that carries <m>x</m> to <m>y</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Clearly <m>G</m> is meant to be a topological group.
            Let <m>e</m> be the identity element of <m>G</m>.
            Define the function <m>\fia : G \to G</m> by <m>\fia(x) = \inv{\a} \cdot x</m>.
            For any any <m>x \in G</m> we then have
            <md>
              <mrow>(\fia \circ \fa)(x) = \fia(\fa(x)) = \fia(\a \cdot x) = \inv{\a} \cdot (\a \cdot x) = (\inv{\a} \cdot \a) \cdot x = e \cdot x = x</mrow>
            </md>
            and
            <md>
              <mrow>(\fa \circ \fia)(x) = \fa(\fia(x)) = \fa(\inv{\a} \cdot x) = \a \cdot (\inv{\a} \cdot x) = (\a \cdot \inv{\a}) \cdot x = e \cdot x = x \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that both <m>\fia \circ \fa = i_G</m> and
            <m>\fa \circ \fia = i_G</m> so that <m>\fia</m> is both a left inverse and a right inverse for <m>\fa</m>
            (see Exercise<nbsp/>2.5).
            Hence <m>\fa</m> is bijective and
            <m>\inv{\fa} = \fia</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>2.5 part<nbsp/>(e).
            An analogous argument shows <m>\ga</m> is bijective and that
            <m>\gia(x) = x \cdot \inv{\a}</m> is its inverse function.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that they are homeomorphisms,
            we note that the group operation is a continuous function since <m>G</m> is a topological group.
            We then have that the operation is continuous in each variable separately by Exercise<nbsp/>18.11.
            From this it clearly follows that both <m>\fa</m> and <m>\ga</m> are continuous since
            <m>\fa(x) = \cdot(\a \times x)</m> and <m>\ga(x) = \cdot (x \times \a)</m>.
            Similarly <m>\inv{\fa}</m> and
            <m>\inv{\ga}</m> are continuous since we have
            <m>\inv{\fa}(x) = \fia(x) = \cdot(\inv{\a} \times x)</m> and <m>\inv{\ga}(x) = \gia(x) = \cdot(x \times \inv{\a})</m>.
            This shows that both <m>\fa</m> and <m>\ga</m> are homeomorphisms by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, to show that <m>G</m> is a homogeneous space,
            consider any points <m>x_0,y_0 \in G</m>.
            Set <m>\a = y_0 \cdot \inv{x_0}</m>,
            noting that of course <m>\a \in G</m>.
            We then claim that <m>\fa</m> as defined above is a homeomorphism that carries <m>x_0</m> to <m>y_0</m>.
            Of course we already showed above that <m>\fa</m> is a homeomorphism,
            so all that remains is to show that <m>\fa(x_0) = y_0</m>.
            To this end we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\fa(x_0) = \a \cdot x_0 = (y_0 \cdot \inv{x_0}) \cdot x_0 = y_0 \cdot (\inv{x_0} \cdot x_0) = y_0 \cdot e = y_0 \,</mrow>
            </md>,

          First we note that it is a well-known theorem of group theory that any subgroup of a group contains the identity element of the group,
          which is also the identity element of the subgroup.
          So, for what follows,
          let <m>e</m> be the identity element of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> above,
          from which it follows that
          <m>x \in xH</m> for any <m>x \in G</m> since we have <m>x = x \cdot e</m> and <m>e \in H</m>.
          We also have that <m>H \in G/H</m> since clearly <m>H = eH</m>.
          Also let <m>p : G \to G/H</m> denote the quotient map corresponding to the quotient space.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Now, for <m>\a \in G</m>,
            define the function <m>h_\a : G/H \to G/H</m> by mapping the left coset
            <m>xH \in G/H</m> to <m>f_\a(x) H = (\a \cdot x)H</m>.
            We note that if <m>xH = yH</m> for
            <m>x,y \in G</m> then of course <m>y \in yH = xH</m> so that
            <m>y = x \cdot h</m> for some <m>h \in H</m>.
            Then
            <md>
              <mrow>f_\a(y) = \a \cdot y = \a \cdot (x \cdot h) = (\a \cdot x) \cdot h = f_\a(x) \cdot h</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>f_\a(y) \in f_\a(x) H</m>,
            which suffices to show that
            <m>f_\a(x)H = f_\a(y)H</m> since <m>G/H</m> is a partition.
            Hence <m>h_\a(yH) = f_\a(y)H = f_\a(x)H = h_\a(xH)</m> so that the mapping <m>h_\a</m> is a well-defined function.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>h_\a</m> is a homeomorphism,
            we first show that it is a bijection.
            Suppose that <m>xH</m> and <m>yH</m> are left cosets where <m>h_\a(xH) = h_\a(yH)</m>.
            Then we have <m>h_\a(xH) = f_\a(x)H = f_\a(y)H = h_\a(yH)</m>,
            and hence <m>f_\a(x) \in f_\a(y)H</m>.
            From this it follows that
            <md>
              <mrow>f_\a(x) = f_\a(y) \cdot h = (\a \cdot y) \cdot h = \a \cdot (y \cdot h) = f_\a(y \cdot h)</mrow>
            </md>
            for some <m>h \in H</m>.
            Since <m>f_\a</m> is injective
            (since it was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.4 to be bijective),
            it has to be that <m>x = y \cdot h</m> so that <m>x \in yH</m>.
            Since also <m>x \in xH</m> and <m>G/H</m> is a partition,
            it must be that <m>xH = yH</m>,
            which shows that <m>h_\a</m> is injective.
            Now consider any coset <m>yH \in G/H</m>.
            Since <m>f_\a</m> is a surjection we have that there is an <m>x \in G</m> where <m>y = f_\a(x)</m>.
            Thus it immediately follows that <m>h_\a(xH) = f_\a(x)H = yH</m>,
            which shows that <m>h_\a</m> is surjective since <m>yH</m> was arbitrary.
            This completes the proof that <m>h_\a</m> is a bijection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we digress a bit and show that
            <m>\bigcup h_\a(\cH) = f_\a\parens{\bigcup \cH}</m> for any subset <m>\cH \ss G/H</m>,
            where we use the notation <m>\bigcup \cA = \bigcup_{A \in \cA} A</m> for a collection of sets <m>\cA</m>.
            So first consider any <m>x_0 \in \bigcup h_\a(\cH)</m> so that there is a coset
            <m>yH \in h_\a(\cH)</m> where <m>x_0 \in yH</m>.
            Then, since <m>yH \in h_\a(\cH)</m>,
            there is another coset <m>xH \in \cH</m> where <m>x_0 \in yH = h_\a(xH) = f_\a(x)H</m>.
            We then have that
            <md>
              <mrow>x_0 = f_\a(x) \cdot h = (\a \cdot x) \cdot h = \a \cdot (x \cdot h) = f_\a(x \cdot h)</mrow>
            </md>
            for some <m>h \in H</m>.
            Since clearly <m>x \cdot h \in xH</m> and <m>xH \in \cH</m>,
            we have that <m>x \cdot h \in \bigcup \cH</m>.
            Then of course <m>x_0 \in f_\a(\bigcup \cH)</m> since <m>x_0 = f_\a(x \cdot h)</m>,
            which shows that <m>\bigcup h_\a(\cH) \ss f_\a\parens{\bigcup \cH}</m> since <m>x_0</m> was arbitrary.
            Now consider <m>x_0 \in f_\a(\bigcup \cH)</m> so that there is a
            <m>y_0 \in \bigcup \cH</m> where <m>x_0 = f_\a(y_0)</m>.
            Then also there is a coset <m>xH \in \cH</m> where
            <m>y_0 \in xH</m> since <m>y_0 \in \bigcup \cH</m>.
            Hence <m>y_0 = x \cdot h</m> for some <m>h \in H</m>.
            Define the coset <m>yH = h_\a(xH) = f_\a(x)H</m> and we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x_0 = f_\a(y_0) = \a \cdot y_0 = \a \cdot (x \cdot h) = (\a \cdot x) \cdot h = f_\a(x) \cdot h</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>x_0 \in f_\a(x)H = yH</m>.
            Then, since <m>yH = h_\a(xH)</m> and <m>xH \in \cH</m>,
            we have that <m>yH \in h_\a(\cH)</m>.
            As we also have <m>x_0 \in yH</m>,
            it follows that <m>x_0 \in \bigcup h_\a(\cH)</m>.
            This shows that <m>\bigcup h_\a(\cH) \sps f_\a\parens{\bigcup \cH}</m> since <m>x_0</m> was arbitrary,
            which completes the proof that <m>\bigcup h_\a(\cH) = f_\a\parens{\bigcup \cH}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To return to the main goal, we therefore have that

            noting that <m>f_\a</m> was shown to be a homeomorphism in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.4.

          <p>
            Lastly, to show that <m>G/H</m> is homogeneous,
            consider two cosets <m>xH,yH \in G/H</m>.
            We know from what was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.4 that there is an <m>f_\a</m> such that <m>y = f_\a(x)</m>.
            If <m>h_\a</m> is the homeomorphism on <m>G/H</m> induced by <m>f_\a</m> as defined above then we have <m>h_\a(xH) = f_\a(x)H = yH</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>G/H</m> is homogeneous since <m>xH</m> and <m>yH</m> were arbitrary.

            Define the single-point subset <m>\cH_0 = \braces{H}</m> of <m>G/H</m>,
            noting that we showed above why <m>H \in G/H</m>.
            We have that <m>\cH_0</m> is closed in <m>G/H</m> since we know that
            <m>\ivp(\cH_0) = \bigcup \cH_0 = H</m> is closed in <m>G</m>,
            which follows from the alternative definition of a quotient map.
            Now consider any arbitrary one-point subset <m>\cH = \braces{xH} \ss G/H</m>.
            Since it was shown in part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>G/H</m> is a homogeneous space,
            there is a homeomorphism <m>h_\a : G/H \to G/H</m> that maps <m>H</m> to <m>xH</m>.
            Then we clearly have that <m>h_\a(\cH_0) = h_\a(\braces{H}) = \braces{xH} = \cH</m>.
            Since <m>\cH_0</m> is closed in <m>G/H</m> and <m>h_\a</m> is a homeomorphism,
            it follows that <m>h_\a(\cH_0) = \cH</m> is also closed in <m>G/H</m>.
            This shows the desired result since <m>\cH</m> was an arbitrary single-point subset.

            <m>(\ss)</m> Consider arbitrary
            <m>x \in \ivp(p(U))</m> so that <m>p(x) \in p(U)</m>.
            Of course <m>p(x) = xH</m> so that
            <m>xH \in p(U)</m> so that there is a <m>y \in U</m> where <m>xH = p(y) = yH</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>x \in yH</m> so that
            <m>x = y \cdot h_0</m> for some <m>h_0 \in H</m>,
            and so <m>x = g_{h_0}(y)</m>.
            Since <m>y \in U</m> we have that <m>x \in g_{h_0}(U)</m>,
            and thus of course <m>x \in \bigcup_{h \in H} g_h(U)</m> since <m>h_0 \in H</m>.
            This shows that <m>\ivp(p(U)) \ss \bigcup_{h \in H} g_h(U)</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now consider <m>x \in \bigcup_{h \in H} g_h(U)</m> so that there is an
            <m>h_0 \in H</m> where <m>x \in g_{h_0}(U)</m>.
            Hence <m>x = g_{h_0}(y)</m> for some <m>y \in U</m>,
            and so <m>x = y \cdot h_0</m>.
            This shows that <m>x \in yH</m> since <m>h_0 \in H</m>,
            and thus it must be that <m>xH = yH</m>.
            However, we have that <m>xH = yH = p(y)</m> and <m>y \in U</m> so that <m>xH \in p(U)</m>.
            Moreover <m>xH = p(x)</m> so that
            <m>p(x) \in p(U)</m> and hence <m>x \in \ivp(p(U))</m>.
            This shows that <m>\ivp(p(U)) \sps \bigcup_{h \in H} g_h(U)</m>,
            which shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, since each <m>g_h</m> is a homeomorphism for <m>h \in H</m> and <m>U</m> is open in <m>G</m>,
            it follows that each <m>g_h(U)</m> also open in <m>G</m>.
            Then of course their union
            <m>\bigcup_{h \in H} g_h(U) = \ivp(p(U))</m> is open in <m>G</m> by the definition of a topology.
            Since <m>\ivp(p(U))</m> is open in <m>G</m>,
            it follows that <m>p(U)</m> is open in <m>G/H</m> since <m>p</m> is a quotient map.
            Then, since <m>U</m> was an arbitrary open set of <m>G</m>,
            this proves that <m>p</m> is an open map.

        </proof>
        <p>
          (d) Recall from algebra that <m>H</m> being a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> means that
          <m>g h \inv{g} \in H</m> for any <m>h \in H</m> and <m>g \in G</m>.
          It is also an equivalent definition of that <m>xy \in H</m> if and only if
          <m>yx \in H</m> for <m>x,y \in G</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we need to show that we can define an operation on <m>G/H</m> that makes it into a group.
            This is done in the expected way:
            for <m>xH,yH \in G/H</m> define <m>xH \cdot yH = (x \cdot y) H</m>.
            To show that this operation is well-defined,
            suppose that <m>x_0H = x_1H</m> and
            <m>y_0H = y_1H</m> are elements of <m>G/H</m>.
            Then of course <m>x_1 \in x_0H</m> so that
            <m>x_1 = x_0 \cdot h_x</m> for some <m>h_x \in H</m>.
            Similarly <m>y_1 \in y_0H</m> so that
            <m>y_1 = y_0 \cdot h_y</m> for some <m>h_y \in H</m>.
            Freely utilizing the associativity of the operation of <m>G</m> and suppressing the <m>\cdot</m> by using multiplication notation,
            we then have that
            <md>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 \amp = (x_0 h_x) (y_0 h_y)</mrow>
              <mrow>(x_1 y_1) \inv{y_0} \amp = (x_0 h_x) (y_0 h_y) \inv{y_0}</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 \inv{y_0} \amp = x_0 h_x (y_0 h_y \inv{y_0})</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 \inv{y_0} \amp = x_0 h_x h_1 \amp  \text{(where \(h_1 = y_0 h_y \inv{y_0} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal)}</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 \inv{y_0} \amp = x_0 h_2 \amp  \text{ (where \(h_2 = h_x h_1 \in H\) since \(H\) is a group) }</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 \inv{y_0} \inv{x_0} \amp = x_0 h_2 \inv{x_0}</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 \inv{y_0} \inv{x_0} \amp = h_3 \amp  \text{(where \(h_3 = x_0 h_2 \inv{x_0} \in H\) since \(H\) is normal)}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence <m>(x_1 y_1) (\inv{y_0} \inv{x_0}) = x_1 y_1 \inv{y_0} \inv{x_0} \in H</m> so that also
            <m>(\inv{y_0} \inv{x_0})(x_1 y_1) \in H</m> by the equivalent definition of a normal subgroup.
            Therefore, for some <m>h \in H</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\inv{y_0} \inv{x_0} x_1 y_1 = (\inv{x_0} \inv{y_0})(x_1 y_1) = h</mrow>
              <mrow>\inv{x_0} x_1 y_1 = y_0 h</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 = x_0 y_0 h</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1 y_1 = (x_0 y_0) h</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>x_1 \cdot y_1 \in (x_0 \cdot y_0) H</m>,
            which of course shows that <m>(x_1 \cdot y_1)H = (x_0 \cdot y_0)H</m>,
            and hence the operation on <m>G/H</m> is well-defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>G/H</m> with this operation satisfies the group axioms.
            We first note that, for <m>x,y \in G</m>,
            we have <m>xH,yH \in G/H</m> and
            <m>x \cdot y \in G</m> since <m>G</m> is a group so that <m>xH \cdot yH = (x \cdot y)H \in G/H</m>.
            Hence the operation is closed in <m>G/H</m>.
            Next, clearly <m>eH = H</m> itself is the identity element for <m>G/H</m> since we have <m>eH \cdot xH = (e \cdot x)H = xH</m> and
            <m>xH \cdot eH = (x \cdot e)H = xH</m> for any <m>xH \in G/H</m>.
            We also have that the inverse element of <m>xH</m> is <m>\inv{x} H</m> since
            <m>xH \cdot \inv{x}H = (x \cdot \inv{x})H = eH</m> and <m>\inv{x}H \cdot xH = (\inv{x} \cdot x)H = eH</m>.
            Lastly, we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>(xH \cdot yH) \cdot zH \amp = (x \cdot y)H \cdot zH = ((x \cdot y) \cdot z)H = (x \cdot (y \cdot z))H</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = xH \cdot (y \cdot z)H = xH \cdot (yH \cdot zH)</mrow>
            </md>
            since of course the operation on <m>G</m> is associative.
            This shows that the operation on <m>G/H</m> is associative as well,
            which completes the proof that <m>G/H</m> is a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>G/H</m> is in fact a topological group,
            first it was shown in part<nbsp/>(b) that one-point subsets of <m>G/H</m> are closed in <m>G/H</m> since <m>H</m> is closed in <m>G</m>.
            From this is follows that <m>G/H</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom since any finite subset of <m>G/H</m> is a finite union of one-point sets and so is also closed in <m>G/H</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point we take a short digression and show that if <m>f: G \times G \to G</m> is continuous,
            then the function <m>h : G/H \times G/H \to G/H</m> defined by <m>h(xH, yH) = f(x,y)H</m> is also continuous.
            To see this,
            we first claim that <m>h \circ (p \times p) = p \circ f</m>,
            where the function <m>p \times p : G \times G \to G/H \times G/H</m> is defined as
            <m>(p \times p)(x,y) = (p(x),p(y))</m> as in Exercise<nbsp/>18.10.
            This is easy to show as we have
            <md>
              <mrow>(h \circ (p \times p))(x,y) \amp = h((p \times p)(x,y)) = h(p(x), p(y)) = h(xH, yH)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = f(x,y)H = p(f(x,y)) = (p \circ f)(x,y)</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>x,y \in G</m>.
            Since both <m>p</m> and <m>f</m> are continuous,
            it follows that <m>p \circ f = h \circ (p \times p)</m> is also continuous by Theorem<nbsp/>18.2 part<nbsp/>(c).
            We also have that <m>p \times p</m> is an open quotient map by the remarks in the text since <m>p</m> is an open quotient map by part<nbsp/>(c).
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point,
            we use Theorem<nbsp/>22.2 to show that <m>h</m> is continuous.
            As this can be confusing, we include the following table,
            which shows how the sets and functions in the statement of Theorem<nbsp/>22.2 map to the sets and functions we are working with:

          <p>
            Now we show that the conditions of the theorem are met.
            We have already shown that <m>p \times p</m> is a quotient map.
            Now let <m>P = \braces{(xH, yH)}</m> be a one-point subset of <m>G/H \times G/H</m>.
            Since <m>p \times p</m> is a quotient map,
            it is surjective so that <m>(p \times p)(\inv{(p \times p)}(P)) = P</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>2.1.
            Then clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>(p \circ f)(\inv{(p \times p)}(P)) \amp = (h \circ (p \times p))(\inv{(p \times p)}(P))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = h((p \times p)(\inv{(p \times p)}(P))) = h(P)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \braces{h(xH, yH)} \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>p \circ f</m> is constant on the set <m>\inv{(p \times p)}(P)</m>.
            Thus <m>p \circ f</m> induces the function <m>h</m> per Theorem<nbsp/>22.2 since <m>h \circ (p \times p) = p \circ f</m> as shown above.
            It then follows by the theorem that <m>h</m> is continuous since we have shown above that <m>p \circ f</m> is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Returning to the main problem,
            since <m>G</m> is a topological group the function <m>f: G \times G \to G</m> defined by
            <m>f(x,y) = x \cdot \inv{y}</m> is continuous by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1.
            It then follows by what was just shown that <m>h : G/H \times G/H \to G/H</m> defined by
            <md>
              <mrow>h(xH, yH) = xH \cdot \inv{(yH)} = xH \cdot \inv{y}H = (x \cdot \inv{y})H = f(x,y)H</mrow>
            </md>
            is also continuous.
            This suffices to show that <m>G/H</m> is also a topological group as desired,
            again by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1.

          The integers <m>\ints</m> are a normal subgroup of <m>(\reals,+)</m>.
          The quotient <m>\reals/\ints</m> is a familiar topological group;

      <solution>
        <p>
          The quotient <m>\reals/\ints</m> is the reals with addition modulo one.
          This is to say that two reals <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are considered equivalent (i.e. they are in the same equivalence class) if <m>x-y \in \ints</m>.
          This is also homeomorphic and isomorphic
          (with respect to the group)
          to the topological group <m>(S^1,\cdot)</m> from Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(d) by the map

              Suppose that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are topological spaces and <m>f: X \times X \to Y</m> is continuous.
              Also suppose that <m>f(x, x) = y</m> for some <m>x \in X</m> and <m>y \in Y</m>.
              Then, for any neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>y</m>,
              there is a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> such that <m>f(U \times U) \ss V</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>V</m> be any neighborhood of <m>y = f(x,x)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
            Then there is a neighborhood <m>U'</m> of <m>(x,x)</m> in <m>X \times X</m> such that
            <m>f(U') \ss V</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>18.1 part<nbsp/>(4).
            Now, since <m>U'</m> is an open set of
            <m>X \times X</m> containing <m>(x,x)</m>,
            there is a basis element <m>B = U_1 \times U_2</m> of
            <m>X \times X</m> such that <m>(x,x) \in U_1 \times U_2 = B \ss U'</m>,
            where of course <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> are open in <m>X</m>.
            Then, being a finite intersection of open sets,
            <m>U = U_1 \cap U_2</m> is also open in <m>X</m> and we have <m>x \in U</m> since
            <m>x \in U_1</m> and <m>x \in U_2</m>.
            Hence <m>U</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> in <m>X</m>,
            and of course both <m>U \ss U_1</m> and <m>U \ss U_2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>z \in f(U \times U)</m> so that there is an
            <m>(x_1,x_2) \in U \times U</m> where <m>f(x_1,x_2) = z</m>.
            Then <m>x_1 \in U \ss U_1</m> and
            <m>x_2 \in U \ss U_2</m> so that <m>(x_1,x_2) \in U_1 \times U_2 = B \ss U'</m>.
            Hence <m>z = f(x_1,x_2) \in f(U')</m> so that also <m>z \in V</m> since <m>f(U') \ss V</m>.
            This shows the desired result that
            <m>f(U \times U) \ss V</m> since <m>z</m> was arbitrary.

            The openness of <m>\a \cdot U</m> and
            <m>U \cdot \a</m> follow almost immediately from what was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.4.
            It is trivial to show that <m>\a \cdot U = f_\a(U)</m>,

            We know from that exercise that <m>f_\a</m> is a homeomorphism so that
            <m>\a \cdot U = f_\a(U)</m> is open since <m>U</m> is.
            Analogously <m>U \cdot \a = g_\a(U)</m> is also open for the same reason,

        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>U \cdot \inv{U}</m> is indeed a neighborhood of <m>e</m>.
            We claim that

            Now, we know from <xref ref="lem_setg_topen">Lemma</xref>
            that each <m>U \cdot \a</m> is open since <m>U</m> is open
            (being a neighborhood of <m>e</m>).
            Hence their union is open by the definition of a topology,
            which shows that <m>U \cdot \inv{U}</m> is in fact open.
            Also, since <m>e \in U</m> and
            <m>\inv{e} = e</m> (a well-known property of the identity element in any group),
            we clearly have that <m>e = e \cdot e = e \cdot \inv{e} \in U \cdot \inv{U}</m> and therefore

            which shows that <m>\inv{(U \cdot \inv{U})} = U \cdot \inv{U}</m> so that

        </p>
        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>U</m> is any neighborhood of <m>e</m>.
            Since <m>G</m> is a topological group,
            we know that the function <m>f: G \times G \to G</m> defined by <m>f(x,y) = x \cdot y</m> is continuous.
            Then, since <m>f(e,e) = e \cdot e = e</m>,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_setg_contf">Lemma</xref>
            that there is a neighborhood <m>V'</m> of <m>e</m> such that <m>f(V' \times V') \ss U</m>.
            Now we claim that <m>f(V' \times V') = V' \cdot V'</m>.
            For any <m>z \in f(V' \times V')</m> we have that there is an
            <m>(x,y) \in V' \times V</m> where <m>f(x,y) = x \cdot y = z</m>.
            Since <m>x,y \in V'</m> and <m>z = x \cdot y</m>,
            this shows that <m>z \in V' \cdot V'</m> so that <m>f(V' \times V') \ss V' \cdot V'</m>.
            To show the other direction,
            for any <m>z \in V' \cdot V'</m> we have that
            <m>z = x \cdot y</m> for some <m>x,y \in V'</m>.
            Then <m>(x,y) \in V' \times V'</m> and
            <m>z = x \cdot y = f(x,y)</m> so that <m>z \in f(V' \times V')</m>,
            which shows that <m>f(V' \times V') \sps V' \cdot V'</m>.
            This shows the desired result that <m>V' \cdot V' = f(V' \times V') \ss U</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly the function <m>g: G \times G \to G</m> defined by
            <m>g(x,y) = x \cdot \inv{y}</m> is also continuous by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1 since <m>G</m> is a topological group.
            Then, since <m>V'</m> is a neighborhood of <m>e</m> and <m>g(e,e) = e \cdot \inv{e} = e \cdot e = e</m>,
            it follows again from <xref ref="lem_setg_contf">Lemma</xref>
            that there is a neighborhood <m>W</m> of <m>e</m> such that <m>g(W \times W) \ss V'</m>.
            We have that <m>W \cdot \inv{W} = g(W \times W)</m> by an argument analogous to that for <m>f</m> above so that <m>W \cdot \inv{W} = g(W \times W) \ss V'</m>.
            Let <m>V = W \cdot \inv{W} \ss V'</m>,
            which we know is a symmetric neighborhood of <m>e</m> by <xref ref="lem_setg_sym">Lemma</xref>
            and is the neighborhood we seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>z \in V \cdot V</m> so that
            <m>z = x \cdot y</m> for some <m>x,y \in V</m>.
            Then also <m>x,y \in V'</m> since <m>V \ss V'</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>z = x \cdot y \in V' \cdot V'</m> so that also <m>z \in U</m> since <m>V' \cdot V' \ss U</m>.
            This shows the desired result that
            <m>V \cdot V \ss U</m> since <m>z</m> was arbitrary,
            which completes the overall proof.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x,y \in G</m> and that <m>x \neq y</m>.
            Then there are neighborhoods <m>U_x'</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>U_y'</m> of <m>y</m> such that
            <m>y \notin U_x'</m> and <m>x \notin U_y'</m>.
            This follows from Exercise<nbsp/>17.15 since <m>G</m> satisfies the <m>T_1</m> axiom on account of it being a topological group.
            Then <m>U_x = U_x' \cdot \inv{x}</m> and
            <m>U_y = U_y' \cdot \inv{y}</m> are both neighborhoods of <m>e</m> since they are open by <xref ref="lem_setg_topen">Lemma</xref>
            and we have that <m>e = x \cdot \inv{x} \in U_x' \cdot \inv{x} = U_x</m> since <m>x \in U_x'</m>,
            and analogously <m>e = y \cdot \inv{y} \in U_y' \cdot \inv{y} = U_y</m> since <m>y \in U_y'</m>.
            Note that we also have that
            <md>
              <mrow>z \in U_y \cdot y \amp \bic z \in (U_y' \cdot \inv{y}) \cdot y</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists y' \in U_y' (z = (y' \cdot \inv{y}) \cdot y)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists y' \in U_y' (z = y' \cdot (\inv{y} \cdot y))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic  \exists y' \in U_y' (z = y' \cdot e)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic  \exists y' \in U_y' (z = y')</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic z \in U_y'</mrow>
            </md>
            so that clearly <m>U_y \cdot y = U_y'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let <m>U = U_x \cap U_y</m>,
            which is also obviously a neighborhood of <m>e</m>.
            It then follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that there is a symmetric neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>e</m> such that <m>V \cdot V \ss U</m>.
            Suppose that <m>V \cdot x</m> and
            <m>V \cdot y</m> are not disjoint so that there is a
            <m>z \in V \cdot x</m> where also <m>z \in V \cdot y</m>.
            Then we have that <m>z = v_x \cdot x = v_y \cdot y</m> for some <m>v_x,v_y \in V</m>.
            It then follows that <m>x = (\inv{v_x} \cdot v_y) \cdot y</m> and,
            since <m>\inv{v_x} \in \inv{V} = V</m> as <m>V</m> is symmetric,
            we have <m>\inv{v_x} \cdot v_y \in V \cdot V \ss U \ss U_y</m>.
            Thus <m>x = (\inv{v_x} \cdot v_y) \cdot y \in U_y \cdot y = U_y'</m>,
            but we know that <m>x</m> cannot be in <m>U_y'</m> by its definition per the <m>T_1</m> axiom!
            This contradiction means that it must be that
            <m>V \cdot x</m> and <m>V \cdot y</m> are disjoint,
            which shows the desired result.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this the fact that <m>G</m> is Hausdorff readily follows.
            Clearly <m>V \cdot x</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> since it is open by <xref ref="lem_setg_topen">Lemma</xref>
            and we have <m>x = e \cdot x \in V \cdot x</m>.
            Similarly <m>V \cdot y</m> is a neighborhood of <m>y</m>.
            As we have shown that these are disjoint,
            this suffices to show that <m>G</m> is a Hausdorff space.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            A proof of this is similar to the proof of part<nbsp/>(b).
            Since <m>A</m> is closed,
            we know that <m>A \cdot \inv{x}</m> is also closed by <xref ref="lem_setg_topen">Lemma</xref>.
            Then <m>G - A \cdot \inv{x}</m> is of course open.
            Moreover if <m>e</m> were in <m>A \cdot \inv{x}</m> then we would have
            <m>e = a \cdot \inv{x}</m> for some <m>a \in A</m> so that <m>a = e \cdot x = x</m>,
            which is not possible since we know that <m>x \notin A</m>.
            So it must be that <m>e \notin A \cdot \inv{x}</m> so that
            <m>e \in G - A \cdot \inv{x}</m> since of course <m>e \in G</m>.
            Hence <m>G - A \cdot \inv{x}</m> is a neighborhood of <m>e</m>,
            and thus there is a symmetric neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>e</m> such that
            <m>V \cdot V \ss G - A \cdot \inv{x}</m> by what was shown in part<nbsp/>(a).
          </p>

            We claim that <m>V \cdot A</m> and <m>V \cdot x</m> are disjoint.
            To see this, suppose to the contrary that there is a
            <m>y \in V \cdot A</m> where also <m>y \in V \cdot x</m>.
            Then <m>y = v_a \cdot a = v_x \cdot x</m> for some <m>v_a,v_x \in V</m> and <m>a \in A</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>v_x \cdot x = v_a \cdot a</mrow>
              <mrow>\inv{v_a} \cdot v_x \cdot x = a</mrow>
              <mrow>\inv{v_a} \cdot v_x = a \cdot \inv{x} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>V</m> is symmetric we have that <m>\inv{v_a} \in \inv{V} = V</m> so that
            <m>\inv{v_a} \cdot v_x \in V \cdot V \ss G - A \cdot \inv{x}</m> and hence <m>\inv{v_a} \cdot v_x \notin A \cdot \inv{x}</m>.
            However, clearly <m>\inv{v_a} \cdot v_x = a \cdot \inv{x}</m> so that
            <m>\inv{v_a} \cdot v_x \in A \cdot \inv{x}</m> since <m>a \in A</m>.
            This contradiction can only mean that in fact
            <m>V \cdot A</m> and <m>V \cdot x</m> are disjoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, for any <m>a \in A</m>,
            we have that <m>a = e \cdot a \in V \cdot A</m> since <m>e \in V</m>,
            which shows that <m>A</m> is contained in <m>V \cdot A</m>.
            Similar to what was done in the beginning of the proof of <xref ref="lem_setg_sym">Lemma</xref>,
            it is easy to show that
            <md>
              <mrow>V \cdot A = \bigcup_{a \in A} V \cdot a \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is open since each <m>V \cdot a</m> is open by <xref ref="lem_setg_topen">Lemma</xref>.
            Thus <m>V \cdot A</m> is an open set containing <m>A</m>.
            We also have that <m>V \cdot x</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> since it is open by <xref ref="lem_setg_topen">Lemma</xref>
            and <m>x = e \cdot x \in V \cdot x</m> since <m>e \in V</m>.
            Since we have already shown that
            <m>V \cdot A</m> and <m>V \cdot x</m> are disjoint,
            this shows the desired result that <m>G</m> satisfies the regularity axiom.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is a closed subset of <m>G/H</m> and <m>xH</m> is an element of <m>G/H</m> not contained in <m>A</m>.
            Then <m>\ivp(A)</m> is a closed subset of <m>G</m> since <m>p</m> is a quotient map.
            Moreover <m>\ivp(A)</m> cannot contain <m>x</m> for,
            if it did, then we would have <m>xH = p(x) \in A</m>.
            So let <m>V</m> be a symmetric neighborhood of <m>e</m> such that
            <m>V \cdot \ivp(A)</m> and <m>V \cdot x</m> are disjoint,
            as shown to exist in part<nbsp/>(c).
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also shown in part<nbsp/>(c) that
            <m>V \cdot \ivp(A)</m> is an open set in <m>G</m> containing <m>\ivp(A)</m> and
            <m>V \cdot x</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m> in <m>G</m>.
            So, for any <m>yH \in A</m> we have that <m>p(y) = yH \in A</m> so that
            <m>y \in \ivp(A)</m> and hence also <m>y \in V \cdot \ivp(A)</m>.
            Then of course <m>yH = p(y) \in p(V \cdot \ivp(A))</m>,
            which shows that <m>A \ss p(V \cdot \ivp(A))</m> since <m>yH</m> was arbitrary.
            We also have that <m>p(V \cdot \ivp(A))</m> is open in <m>G/H</m> since
            <m>V \cdot \ivp(A)</m> is open in <m>G</m> and <m>p</m> is an open map by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.5 part<nbsp/>(c).
            Similarly, since <m>x \in V \cdot x</m>,
            we have that <m>xH = p(x) \in p(V \cdot x)</m> and
            <m>p(V \cdot x)</m> is open in <m>G/H</m> since <m>p</m> is an open map.
            Thus <m>p(V \cdot x)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>xH</m> in <m>G/H</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>p(V \cdot \ivp(A))</m> and
            <m>p(V \cdot x)</m> are disjoint subsets of <m>G/H</m>.
            Suppose to the contrary that they are not so that there is a
            <m>zH \in p(V \cdot \ivp(A))</m> where also <m>zH \in p(V \cdot x)</m>.
            Then we have that there is a
            <m>y_a \in V \cdot \ivp(A)</m> where <m>z = p(y_a)</m> and likewise a
            <m>y_x \in V \cdot x</m> where <m>z = p(y_x)</m>.
            Thus <m>y_a H = p(y_a) = z = p(y_x) = y_x H</m> so that <m>y_x \in y_a H</m>,
            and hence there is an <m>h \in H</m> where <m>y_x = y_a \cdot h</m>.
            Also since <m>y_a \in V \cdot \ivp(A)</m> we have <m>y_a = v_a \cdot a'</m> for some
            <m>v_a \in V</m> and <m>a' \in \ivp(A)</m>.
            Putting this together we have
            <md>
              <mrow>y_x = y_a \cdot h = v_a \cdot a' \cdot h \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>a' \in \ivp(A)</m> we have that <m>a'H = p(a') \in A</m>.
            Also clearly <m>a' \cdot h \in a'H</m> since <m>h \in H</m>.
            Therefore <m>a' \cdot h \in \bigcup A = \ivp(A)</m>.
            Hence we have that <m>y_x = v_a \cdot (a' \cdot h) \in V \cdot \ivp(A)</m>.
            Since also <m>y_x \in V \cdot x</m>,
            this violates the fact that
            <m>V \cdot \ivp(A)</m> and <m>V \cdot x</m> are disjoint.
            This contradiction means that it must be that in fact
            <m>p(V \cdot \ivp(A))</m> and <m>p(V \cdot x)</m> are disjoint,
            which completes the proof that <m>G/H</m> satisfies the regularity axiom.
