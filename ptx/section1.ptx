      <statement>
        <p>
          Check the distributive laws for <m>\cup</m> and <m>\cap</m> and DeMorgan's laws.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are sets.
          First we show that <m>A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this as a series of logical equivalences:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in A \cap (B \cup C) \amp \bic x \in A \land x \in B \cup C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \land (x \in B \lor x \in C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic (x \in A \land x \in B) \lor (x \in A \land x \in C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \cap B \lor x \in A \cap C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which of course shows the desired result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show that <m>A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this in the same way:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in A \cup (B \cap C) \amp \bic x \in A \lor x \in B \cap C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \lor (x \in B \land x \in C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic (x \in A \lor x \in B) \land (x \in A \lor x \in C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \cup B \land x \in A \cup C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which of course shows the desired result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we show the first DeMorgan's law that <m>A - (B \cup C) = (A - B) \cap (A - C)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this in the same way:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in A - (B \cup C) \amp \bic x \in A \land x \notin B \cup C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \land \lnot (x \in B \lor x \in C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \land (x \notin B \land x \notin C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic (x \in A \land x \notin B) \land (x \in A \land x \notin C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A - B \land x \in A - C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in (A - B) \cap (A - C) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is the desired result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly we show that <m>A - (B \cap C) = (A - B) \cup (A - C)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Again we use a sequence of logical equivalences:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in A - (B \cap C) \amp \bic x \in A \land x \notin B \cap C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \land \lnot (x \in B \land x \in C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A \land (x \notin B \lor x \notin C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic (x \in A \land x \notin B) \lor (x \in A \land x \notin C)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in A - B \lor x \in A - C</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in (A - B) \cup (A - C) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            as desired.
          </p>

          (a) We claim that <m>A \ss B</m> and
          <m>A \ss C \imp A \ss (B \cup C)</m> but that the converse is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A \ss B</m> and <m>A \ss C</m> and consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then clearly also <m>x \in B</m> since <m>A \ss B</m> so that <m>x \in B \cup C</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>A \ss (B \cup C)</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that the converse is not true,
            suppose that <m>A = \braces{1,2,3}</m>,
            <m>B = \braces{1,2}</m>, and <m>C = \braces{3, 4}</m>.
            Then clearly <m>A \ss \braces{1,2,3,4} = B \cup C</m> but it neither true that <m>A \ss B</m>
            (since <m>3 \in A</m> but <m>3 \notin B</m>)
            nor <m>A \ss C</m>
            (since <m>1 \in A</m> but <m>1 \notin C</m>).
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) We claim that <m>A \ss B</m> or
          <m>A \ss C \imp A \ss (B \cup C)</m> but that the converse is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A \ss B</m> or <m>A \ss C</m> and consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            If <m>A \ss B</m> then clearly <m>x \in B</m> so that <m>x \in B \cup C</m>.
            If <m>A \ss C</m> then clearly <m>x \in C</m> so that again <m>x \in B \cup C</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>A \ss (B \cup C)</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            The counterexample that disproves the converse of part<nbsp/>(a),
            also serves as a counterexample to the converse here.
            Again this is because <m>A \ss B \cup C</m> but neither <m>A \ss B</m> nor <m>A \ss C</m>,
            which is to say that <m>A \nss B</m> and <m>A \nss C</m>.
            Hence it is not true that <m>A \ss B</m> or <m>A \ss C</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c) We claim that this biconditional is true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that <m>A \ss B</m> and <m>A \ss C</m> and consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then clearly also <m>x \in B</m> and <m>x \in C</m> since both <m>A \ss B</m> and <m>A \ss C</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in B \cap C</m>,
            which proves that <m>A \ss B \cap C</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that
            <m>A \ss B \cap C</m> and consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then <m>x \in B \cap C</m> as well so that <m>x \in B</m> and <m>x \in C</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>A</m>,
            this of course shows that both <m>A \ss B</m> and <m>A \ss C</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d) We claim that only the converse is true here.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            To show the converse, suppose that <m>A \ss B \cap C</m>.
            It was shown in part<nbsp/>(c) that this implies that both <m>A \ss B</m> and <m>A \ss C</m>.
            Thus it is clearly true that <m>A \ss B</m> or <m>A \ss C</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a counterexample to the forward implication,
            let <m>A = \braces{1}</m>, <m>B = \braces{1,2}</m>,
            and <m>C = \braces{3,4}</m> so that clearly <m>A \ss B</m> and hence <m>A \ss B</m> or <m>A \ss C</m> is true.
            However we have that <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are disjoint so that <m>B \cap C = \es</m>,
            therefore <m>A \nss \es = B \cap C</m> since <m>A \neq \es</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (e) We claim that <m>A - (A - B) \ss B</m> but that the other direction is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>x \in A - (A - B)</m> so that <m>x \in A</m> but <m>x \notin A - B</m>.
            Hence it is not true that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \notin B</m>.
            So it must be that <m>x \notin A</m> or <m>x \in B</m>.
            However, since we know that <m>x \in A</m>,
            it has to be that <m>x \in B</m>.
            Thus <m>A - (A - B) \ss B</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>A = \braces{1,2}</m> and <m>B = \braces{2,3}</m>.
            Then we clearly have <m>A - B = \braces{1}</m>,
            and thus <m>A - (A - B) = \braces{2}</m>.
            So clearly <m>B</m> is not a subset of
            <m>A - (A - B)</m> since <m>3 \in B</m> but <m>3 \notin A - (A - B)</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (f) Here we claim that <m>A - (B - A) \sps A - B</m> but that the other direction is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>x \in A - B</m> so that <m>x \in A</m> but <m>x \notin B</m>.
            Then it is certainly true that
            <m>x \notin B</m> or <m>x \in A</m> so that, by logical equivalence,
            it is not true that <m>x \in B</m> and <m>x \notin A</m>.
            That is, it is not true that <m>x \in B - A</m>,
            which is to say that <m>x \notin B - A</m>.
            Since also <m>x \in A</m>, it follows that <m>x \in A - (B - A)</m>,
            which shows the desired result since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that the other direction does not hold consider the counterexample
            <m>A = \braces{1,2}</m> and <m>B = \braces{2, 3}</m>.
            Then <m>B - A = \braces{3}</m> so that <m>A - (B - A) = \braces{1, 2} = A</m>.
            We also have that <m>A - B = \braces{1}</m> so that
            <m>2 \in A - (B - A)</m> but <m>2 \notin A - B</m>.
            This suffices to show that <m>A - (B - A) \nss A - B</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (g) We claim that equality holds here,
          i.e. that <m>A \cap (B - C) = (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> Suppose that <m>x \in A \cap (B - C)</m> so that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \in B - C</m>.
            Thus <m>x \in B</m> but <m>x \notin C</m>.
            Since both <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \in B</m> we have that <m>x \in A \cap B</m>.
            Also since <m>x \notin C</m> it clearly must be that <m>x \notin A \cap C</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)</m>,
            which shows the forward direction since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now suppose that <m>x \in (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in A \cap B</m> but <m>x \notin A \cap C</m>.
            From the former of these we have that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>x \in B</m>,
            and from the latter it follows that either
            <m>x \notin A</m> or <m>x \notin C</m>.
            Since we know that <m>x \in A</m>,
            it must therefore be that <m>x \notin C</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in B - C</m> since <m>x \in B</m> but <m>x \notin C</m>.
            Since also <m>x \in A</m> we have that <m>x \in A \cap (B - C)</m>,
            which shows the desired result since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.

          (h) Here we claim that <m>A \cup (B - C) \sps (A \cup B) - (A \cup C)</m> but that the forward direction is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>x \in (A \cup B) - (A \cup C)</m> so that
            <m>x \in A \cup B</m> and <m>x \notin A \cup C</m>.
            From the latter, it follows that <m>x \notin A</m> and
            <m>x \notin C</m> since otherwise we would have <m>x \in A \cup C</m>.
            From the former,
            we have that <m>x \in A</m> or <m>x \in B</m> so that it must be that <m>x \in B</m> since <m>x \notin A</m>.
            Therefore we have that <m>x \in B</m> and
            <m>x \notin C</m> so that <m>x \in B - C</m>.
            From this it obviously follows that <m>x \in A \cup (B - C)</m>,
            which shows that <m>A \cup (B - C) \sps (A \cup B) - (A \cup C)</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that the forward direction does not always hold,
            consider the sets <m>A = \braces{1,2}</m>,
            <m>B = \braces{2, 3}</m>, and <m>C = \braces{2}</m>.
            Then we clearly have that <m>B - C = \braces{3}</m>,
            and hence <m>A \cup (B - C) = \braces{1,2,3}</m>.
            On the other hand, we have <m>A \cup B = \braces{1,2,3}</m> and
            <m>A \cup C = \braces{1,2}</m> so that <m>(A \cup B) - (A \cup C) = \braces{3}</m>.
            Hence, for example,
            <m>1 \in A \cup (B - C)</m> but <m>1 \notin (A \cup B) - (A \cup C)</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>A \cup (B - C) \nss (A \cup B) - (A \cup C)</m> as desired.

            We show this with a chain of logical equivalences:

            where we note that
            <q>True</q>
            denotes the fact that <m>x \in B \lor x \notin B</m> is always true by the excluded middle property of logic.

            Suppose that <m>A \ss C</m> and <m>B \ss D</m>.
            Consider any <m>(x,y) \in A \times B</m> so that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in B</m> by the definition of the cartesian product.
            Then also clearly <m>x \in C</m> and <m>y \in D</m> since <m>A \ss C</m> and <m>B \ss D</m>.
            Hence <m>(x,y) \in C \times D</m>,
            which shows the result since the ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>

          (k) We claim that the converse of (j) is not always true.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider the following sets:
            <md>
              <mrow>A \amp = \es \amp  C \amp = \braces{1}</mrow>
              <mrow>B \amp = \braces{1,2} \amp  D \amp = \braces{2} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we have that <m>A \times B = \es</m> since there are no ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> such that <m>x \in A</m>
            (since <m>A = \es</m>).
            Hence it is vacuously true that <m>(A \times B) \ss (C \times D)</m>.
            However, clearly it is not the case that <m>B \ss D</m>,
            and so, even though <m>A \ss C</m>,
            it is not true that <m>A \ss C</m> and <m>B \ss D</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (l) We claim that the converse of (j) is true with the stipulation that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both nonempty.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>(A \times B) \ss (C \times D)</m>.
            First consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then, since <m>B \neq \es</m>,
            there is a <m>b \in B</m>.
            Then <m>(x,b) \in A \times B</m> so that clearly also <m>(x,b) \in C \times D</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in C</m> so that <m>A \ss C</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            An analogous argument shows that <m>B \ss D</m> since <m>A</m> is nonempty.
            Hence it is true that <m>A \ss C</m> and <m>B \ss D</m> as desired.

        <p>
          (m) Here we claim that <m>(A \times B) \cup (C \times D) \ss (A \cup C) \times (B \cup D)</m> but that the other direction is not always true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>(x,y) \in (A \times B) \cup (C \times D)</m> so that either
            <m>(x,y) \in A \times B</m> or <m>(x,y) \in C \times D</m>.
            In the first case <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in B</m> so that clearly
            <m>x \in A \cup C</m> and <m>y \in B \cup D</m>.
            Hence <m>(x, y) \in (A \cup C) \times (B \cup D)</m>.
            In the second case we have <m>x \in C</m> and <m>y \in D</m> so that again
            <m>x \in A \cup C</m> and <m>y \in B \cup D</m> are still both true.
            Hence of course <m>(x, y) \in (A \cup C) \times (B \cup D)</m> here also.
            This shows the result in either case since <m>(x,y)</m> was an arbitrary ordered pair.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that the other direction does not always hold,
            consider <m>A = B = \braces{1}</m> and <m>C = D = \braces{2}</m>.
            Then we clearly have <m>A \times B = \braces{(1,1)}</m> and
            <m>C \times D = \braces{(2,2)}</m> so that <m>(A \times B) \cup (C \times D) = \braces{(1,1), (2,2)}</m>.
            We also have <m>A \cup C = B \cup D = \braces{1,2}</m> so that <m>(A \cup C) \times (B \cup D) = \braces{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}</m>.
            This clearly shows that <m>(A \times B) \cup (C \times D) \not \sps (A \cup C) \times (B \cup D)</m> as desired.

            From the latter of these we have that <m>y \in B</m> but <m>y \notin C</m>.
            We clearly then have that <m>(x,y) \in A \times B</m> since <m>x\in A</m> and <m>y \in B</m>.
            It also has to be that <m>(x,y) \notin A \times C</m> since
            <m>y \notin C</m> even though it is true that <m>x\ in A</m>.
            Therefore <m>(x,y) \in (A \times B) - (A \times C)</m> as desired.
          </p>

            From the former we have that <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in B</m>.
            It then must be that <m>y \notin C</m> since
            <m>(x,y) \notin (A \times C)</m> but we know that <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then we have <m>y \in B - C</m> since <m>y \in B</m> but <m>y \notin C</m>.
            Since also <m>x \in A</m>,
            it follows that <m>(x,y) \in A \times (B-C)</m> as desired.
          </p>

        <proof>

            <m>(\ss)</m> Suppose that <m>(x,y) \in (A - B) \times (C - D)</m> so that
            <m>x \in A - B</m> and <m>y \in C - D</m>.
            Then we have that <m>x \in A</m>,
            <m>x \notin B</m>, <m>y \in C</m>, and <m>y \notin D</m>.
            So first, clearly <m>(x,y) \in A \times C</m>.
            Then, since <m>x \notin B</m>,
            we have that <m>(x,y) \notin B \times C</m>,
            and hence <m>(x,y) \in A \times C - B \times C</m>.
            Since <m>y \notin D</m>, we also have that <m>(x,y) \notin A \times D</m>,
            and thus <m>(x,y) \in (A \times C - B \times C) - A \times D</m>.
            This clearly shows the desired result since <m>(x,y)</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now suppose that <m>(x,y) \in (A \times C - B \times C) - A \times D</m> so that

            From the former we have that
            <m>(x,y) \in A \times C</m> and <m>(x,y) \notin B \times C</m>.
            Thus <m>x \in A</m> and <m>y \in C</m> so that it has to be that <m>x \notin B</m> since
            <m>(x,y) \notin B \times C</m> but we know that <m>y \in C</m>.
            It also must be that <m>y \notin D</m> since <m>(x,y) \notin A \times D</m> but <m>x \in A</m>.
            Therefore we have that <m>x \in A</m>,
            <m>x \notin B</m>, <m>y \in C</m>, and <m>y \notin D</m>,
            from which it readily follows that
            <m>x \in A - B</m> and <m>y \in C - D</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>(x,y) \in (A-B) \times (C-D)</m>,

        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>(x,y) \in (A - C) \times (B - D)</m> so that

            Thus we have <m>x \in A</m>,
            <m>x \notin C</m>, <m>y \in B</m>, and <m>y \notin D</m>.
            From this clearly <m>(x,y) \in A \times B</m> but <m>(x,y) \notin C \times D</m>.
            Hence <m>(x,y) \in (A \times B) - (C \times D)</m>,

            <m>C = \braces{2,3}</m>, and <m>D = \braces{b,c}</m>.
            We then clearly have the following sets:

              Write the contrapositive and converse of the following statement:
              <q>If <m>x \lt 0</m>, then <m>x^2 - x > 0</m>,</q>
              and determine which

              of the three statements are true.

              Do the same for the statement
              <q>If <m>x > 0</m>, then <m>x^2 - x > 0</m>.</q>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          (a) First we claim that the original statement is true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>x \lt 0</m> we clearly have that <m>x-1 \lt x \lt 0</m> as well.
            Then, since the product of two negative numbers is positive,
            we have that <m>x^2 - x = x(x-1) > 0</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          The contrapositive of this is,
          <q>If <m>x^2 - x \leq 0</m>, then <m>x \geq 0</m>.</q>
          This is of course also true by virtue of the fact that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the converse of this statement is,
          <q>If <m>x^2 - x > 0</m>, then <m>x \lt 0</m>.</q>
          We claim that this is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            A simple counterexample of <m>x = 2</m> shows this.
            We have <m>x^2 - x = 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 > 0</m>,
            but also clearly <m>x = 2 > 0</m> as well so that <m>x \lt 0</m> is clearly false.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) First we claim that this statement is false.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample, let <m>x = 1/2</m>.
            Then clearly <m>x > 0</m>,
            but we also have <m>x^2 - x = (1/2)^2 - 1/2 = 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4 \lt 0</m> so that
            <m>x^2-x > 0</m> is obviously not true.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          The contrapositive is then
          <q>If <m>x^2 - x \leq 0</m>, then <m>x \leq 0</m>,</q>
          which is false since it is logically equivalent to the original statement.
        </p>

        <p>
          (b) The implication is generally false.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample,
            consider <m>\cA = \braces{\braces{1}, \braces{2}}</m>.
            Then clearly <m>\bigcup_{A \in \cA} A = \braces{1, 2}</m> so that <m>1 \in \bigcup_{A \in \cA} A</m>,
            but <m>1</m> is not in <m>A</m> for every

        <p>
          However, the converse <em>is</em> true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x \in A</m> for every <m>A \in \cA</m>.
            Since <m>\cA</m> is nonempty there is an <m>A_0 \in \cA</m>.
            Then <m>x \in A_0</m> since <m>A_0 \in \cA</m>.
            Hence by definition <m>x \in \bigcup_{A \in \cA} A</m> since
            <m>x \in A_0</m> and <m>A_0 \in \cA</m>.
          </p>

          (c) The implication here is true.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x \in \bigcap_{A \in \cA} A</m> so that by definition <m>x \in A</m> for every <m>A \in \cA</m>.
            Since <m>\cA</m> is nonempty there is an
            <m>A_0 \in \cA</m> so that in particular <m>x \in A_0</m>.
            This shows the desired result since <m>A_0 \in \cA</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          The converse is not generally true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As a counterexample consider <m>\cA = \braces{\braces{1,2}, \braces{2,3}}</m>.
            Then <m>1 \in \braces{1,2}</m> and <m>\braces{1,2} \in \cA</m>,
            but <m>1 \notin \bigcap_{A \in \cA} A</m> since clearly <m>\bigcap_{A \in \cA} A = \braces{2}</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          If a set <m>A</m> has two elements,
          show that <m>\pset{A}</m> has four elements.
          How many elements does <m>\pset{A}</m> have if <m>A</m> has one element?
          Three elements?
          No elements?
          Why is <m>\pset{A}</m> called the power set of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We claim that if a finite set has <m>n</m> elements,
          then its power set has <m>2^n</m> elements,
          which is why it is called the power set.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this by induction on the size of the set.
            For the base case start with the the empty set in which <m>n = 0</m>.
            Clearly the only subset of <m>\es</m> is the trivial subset <m>\es</m> itself so that <m>\pset{\es} = \braces{\es}</m>.
            This has <m>1 = 2^0 = 2^n</m> element obviously,
            which shows the base case.
            Now suppose that the power set of any set with <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> elements.
            Let <m>A</m> be a set with <m>n+1</m> elements,
            noting that this is nonempty since
            <m>n+1 \geq 1</m> since <m>n \geq 0</m>.
            Hence there is an <m>x \in A</m>.
            For any subset <m>B \ss A</m>,
            either <m>x \notin B</m> or <m>x \in B</m>.
            In the first case <m>B</m> is a subset of <m>A - \braces{x}</m> and in the latter
            <m>B = \braces{x} \cup C</m> for some <m>C \ss A - \braces{x}</m>.
            Therefore <m>\pset{A}</m> has twice the number of elements of <m>\pset{A - \braces{x}}</m>,
            one half being just the elements of
            <m>A - \braces{x}</m> and the other being those elements with <m>x</m> added in.
            But <m>A - \braces{x}</m> has <m>n</m> elements since <m>A</m> has <m>n+1</m>,
            and hence <m>\pset{A - \braces{x}}</m> has <m>2^n</m> elements by the induction hypothesis.
            Thus <m>\pset{A}</m> has <m>2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1}</m> elements,
            which completes the induction.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Using this, we can answer all of the specific questions.
          If a set has two elements, than its power set has <m>2^2 = 4</m> elements.
          If it has one element, then its power set has <m>2^1 = 2</m> elements,
          namely <m>\pset{\braces{x}} = \braces{\es, \braces{x}}</m>.
          If a set has three elements then its power set has <m>2^3 = 8</m> elements.
          Lastly, if a set has no elements (i.e. it is the empty set),
          then its power set has <m>2^0 = 1</m> elements.
          As noted in the proof we have <m>\pset{\es} = \braces{\es}</m>.

            Let <m>A = \braces{(x,y) \where y > x}</m> and suppose to the contrary that
            <m>A = B \times C</m> where <m>B,C \ss \reals</m>.
            Since <m>1 > 0</m>, we have that <m>(0,1) \in A</m>.
            Then also <m>0 \in B</m> and <m>1 \in C</m> since <m>A = B \times C</m>.
            We also have that <m>1 \in B</m> and <m>2 \in C</m> since <m>2 > 1</m> so that <m>(1,2) \in A = B \times C</m>.
            Thus <m>1 \in B</m> and <m>1 \in C</m> so that <m>(1,1) \in B \times C = A</m>,
            but this cannot be since it is not true that <m>1 > 1</m>.
            Hence we have a contradiction so that <m>A</m> cannot be expressed as <m>B \times C</m>.

          (e) We claim that this set cannot be expressed as the cartesian product of subsets of <m>\reals</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>A = \braces{(x,y) \where x^2 + y^2 \lt 1}</m> and suppose to the contrary that
            <m>A = B \times C</m> where <m>B,C \ss \reals</m>.
            We then have that <m>(9/10)^2 + 0^2 = 81/100 + 0 = 81/100 \lt 1</m> so that <m>(9/10, 0) \in A = B \times C</m>,
            and hence <m>9/10 \in B</m> and <m>0 \in C</m>.
            Also <m>0^2 + (9/10)^2 = (9/10)^2 + 0^2 = 81/100 \lt 1</m> so that <m>(0, 9/10) \in A = B \times C</m>,
            and hence <m>0 \in B</m> and <m>9/10 \in C</m>.
            Hence <m>(9/10, 9/10) \in B \times C = A</m> since <m>9/10</m> is in both <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>.
            However, we have <m>(9/10)^2 + (9/10)^2 = 81/100 + 81/100 = 162/100 \geq 1</m> so that
            <m>(9/10, 9/10)</m> cannot be in <m>A</m>,
            so we have a contradiction.
            So it must be that <m>A</m> cannot be equal to <m>B \times C</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in A_0</m> and let
            <m>y = f(x)</m> so that clearly <m>y \in f(A_0)</m>.
            Then, since <m>f(x) = y \in f(A_0)</m>,
            it follows from the definition of the preimage that <m>x \in \ivf(f(A_0))</m>.
            Hence <m>A_0 \ss \ivf(f(A_0))</m> as desired since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            Now suppose that <m>f</m> is also injective and consider this time any <m>x \in \ivf(f(A_0))</m> so that
            <m>y = f(x) \in f(A_0)</m> by the definition of a preimage.
            Then there is an <m>x' \in A_0</m> where
            <m>f(x') = y = f(x)</m> by the definition of an image.
            Since <m>f</m> injective though,
            it must be that <m>x = x' \in A_0</m>.
            This shows that <m>\ivf(f(A_0)) \ss A_0</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            The desired equality follows since it was already shown that <m>A_0 \ss \ivf(f(A_0))</m>
            (whether or not <m>f</m> is injective).

          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>y</m> is any element of <m>f(\ivf(B_0))</m> so that there is an
            <m>x \in \ivf(B_0)</m> where <m>f(x) = y</m>.
            Since <m>x \in \ivf(B_0)</m>,
            we then have that <m>y = f(x) \in B_0</m> by the definition of a preimage.
            Hence <m>f(\ivf(B_0)) \ss B_0</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Now suppose also that <m>f</m> is surjective and suppose that
            <m>y \in B_0</m> so that also clearly <m>y \in B</m> since <m>B_0 \ss B</m>.
            Since <m>f</m> is surjective,
            there is an <m>x \in A</m> where <m>f(x) = y</m>.
            We then have that <m>x \in \ivf(B_0)</m> since <m>f(x) = y \in B_0</m>.
            Clearly then <m>y = f(x) \in f(\ivf(B_0))</m> so that
            <m>B_0 \ss f(\ivf(B_0))</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows equality as desired.

            Hence of course <m>x \in A_0</m> and <m>x \in A_1</m>.
            Since also <m>y = f(x)</m>,
            this suffices to show that

            Now suppose that <m>f</m> is injective and consider any <m>y \in f(A_0) \cap f(A_1)</m>.
            Then <m>y \in f(A_0)</m> and <m>y \in f(A_1)</m>,

            and an <m>x_1 \in A_1</m> where <m>y = f(x_1)</m>.
            We then have <m>f(x_0) = y = f(x_1)</m> so that
            <m>x_0 = x_1</m> since <m>f</m> is injective.
            Hence <m>x_0 \in A_0</m> and <m>x_0 = x_1 \in A_1</m>,

            Since also <m>y = f(x_0)</m>,
            this shows by definition that <m>y \in f(A_0 \cap A_1)</m>.
            Therefore <m>f(A_0) \cap f(A_1) \ss f(A_0 \cap A_1)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,

            Then there is an <m>x \in A_0</m> where <m>y = f(x)</m>.
            We also have that there is no

            Since we know that <m>y = f(x)</m> it then has to be that <m>x \notin A_1</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in A_0 - A_1</m>,
            so that <m>y \in f(A_0 - A_1)</m> since of course <m>y = f(x)</m>.
            This shows that <m>f(A_0 - A_1) \sps f(A_0) - f(A_1)</m> as desired since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.

            Then <m>x \in A_0</m> but <m>x \notin A_1</m>.
            It then follows that <m>y \in f(A_0)</m> since

            Consider any <m>x' \in A_1</m>.
            Then it cannot be that <m>y = f(x')</m>,
            because if this were the case then
            <m>f(x) = y = f(x')</m> so that <m>x = x'</m> since <m>f</m> is injective.
            But we know that <m>x' = x \notin A_1</m>,
            which would present a contradiction.
            So it must be that there is no
            <m>x' \in A_1</m> where <m>y = f(x')</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>y \notin f(A_1)</m>.
            Therefore <m>y \in f(A_0) - f(A_1)</m> so that
            <m>f(A_0 - A_1) \ss f(A_0) - f(A_1)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            This of course shows equivalence as desired.

          In what follows suppose that
          <m>f: A \to B</m> and that <m>\cA</m> and <m>\cB</m> are nonempty collections of subsets of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
          respectively.
          This is to say that <m>A' \ss A</m> for all <m>A' \in \cA</m> and
          <m>B' \ss B</m> for all <m>B' \in \cB</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we show that part in Exercise<nbsp/>2.2 part<nbsp/>(b) holds for arbitrary unions,
          i.e. that
          <md>
            <mrow>\ivf\parens{\bigcup_{B' \in \cB} B'} = \bigcup_{B' \in \cB} \ivf(B') \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As before, we again show this with a string of biconditional assertions:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in \ivf\parens{\bigcup_{B' \in \cB} B'} \amp \bic f(x) \in \bigcup_{B' \in \cB} B'</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists B' \in \cB (f(x) \in B')</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists B' \in \cB (x \in \ivf(B'))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in \bigcup_{B' \in \cB} \ivf(B')</mrow>
            </md>
            as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Next we show Exercise<nbsp/>2.2 part<nbsp/>(c) for arbitrary intersections, that is
          <md>
            <mrow>\ivf\parens{\bigcap_{B' \in \cB} B'} = \bigcap_{B' \in \cB} \ivf(B') \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this with a string of bijections again:
            <md>
              <mrow>x \in \ivf\parens{\bigcap_{B' \in \cB} B'} \amp \bic f(x) \in \bigcap_{B' \in \cB} B'</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \forall B' \in \cB (f(x) \in B')</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \forall B' \in \cB (x \in \ivf(B'))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic x \in \bigcap_{B' \in \cB} \ivf(B') \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows the desired result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we show Exercise<nbsp/>2.2 part<nbsp/>(f) for arbitrary unions,
          that is that
          <md>
            <mrow>f\parens{\bigcup_{A' \in \cA} A'} = \bigcup_{A' \in \cA} f(A') \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Again we utilize a string of biconditionals:
            <md>
              <mrow>y \in f\parens{\bigcup_{A' \in \cA} A'} \amp \bic \exists x \squares{x \in \bigcup_{A' \in \cA} A' \land y = f(x)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists x \squares{\exists A' \in \cA (x \in A') \land y = f(x)}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists x \squares{\exists A' \in \cA (x \in A' \land y = f(x))}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists x \exists A' \in \cA (x \in A' \land y = f(x))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists A' \in \cA \exists x (x \in A' \land y = f(x))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists A' \in \cA \squares{\exists x (x \in A' \land y = f(x))}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic \exists A' \in \cA \squares{y \in f(A')}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \bic y \in \bigcup_{A' \in \cA} f(A') \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            from which the result follows immediately.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Lastly, we show Exercise<nbsp/>2.2 part<nbsp/>(g) for arbitrary intersections,
          which is that
          <md>
            <mrow>f\parens{\bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'} \ss \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} f(A') \,</mrow>
          </md>,
          where equality holds if <m>f</m> is injective.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>y \in f\parens{\bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'}</m> so that there is an
            <m>x \in \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'</m> where <m>y = f(x)</m>.
            Then <m>x \in A'</m> for every <m>A' \in \cA</m>.
            So, for any such <m>A' \in \cA</m>,
            we have that <m>x \in A'</m> and
            <m>y = f(x)</m> so that <m>y \in f(A')</m>.
            Since <m>A'</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>y \in \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} f(A')</m>,
            which shows the desired result since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>f</m> is injective and let <m>y \in \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} f(A')</m>.
            Then <m>y \in f(A')</m> for every <m>A' \in \cA</m>.
            So, for any such <m>A_0 \in \cA</m> we have that <m>y \in f(A_0)</m> so that there is a
            <m>x_0 \in A_0</m> where <m>y = f(x_0)</m>.
            Suppose for the moment that <m>x_0 \notin \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'</m> so that there is an
            <m>A_1 \in \cA</m> where <m>x_0 \notin A_1</m>.
            However, since <m>A_1 \in \cA</m> we have that <m>y \in f(A_1)</m>,
            and hence there is an <m>x_1 \in A_1</m> where <m>y = f(x_1)</m>.
            But then we have <m>f(x_0) = y = f(x_1)</m> so that
            <m>x_0 = x_1</m> since <m>f</m> is injective,
            and so we have that both <m>x_0 \notin A_1</m> and <m>x_0 = x_1 \in A_1</m>.
            As this is a contradiction,
            it has to be that <m>x_0 \in \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'</m>.
            Since also <m>y = f(x_0)</m>,
            this shows that <m>y \in f\parens{\bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'}</m>.
            This shows that <m>f\parens{\bigcap_{A' \in \cA} A'} \sps \bigcap_{A' \in \cA} f(A')</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            which in turns proves the desired equivalence.

            Suppose that <m>x,y \in A</m> and <m>x \neq y</m>.
            Then, since <m>f</m> is injective,
            it has to be that <m>f(x) \neq f(y)</m> by the contrapositive of the definition of an injection.
            Then again <m>(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) \neq g(f(y)) = (g \circ f)(y)</m> since
            <m>f(x) \neq f(y)</m> and <m>g</m> is injective.

          (c) Here we claim that if <m>g \circ f</m> is injective,

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>g \circ f</m> is injective but that <m>f</m> is not.
            Then there are <m>x,y \in A</m> where
            <m>x \neq y</m> but <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
            Then we have

            which contradicts the fact that
            <m>g \circ f</m> is injective since <m>x \neq y</m>.
            So it must be that <m>f</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> need not be injective, consider the sets

            It is easy to see that <m>f: A \to B</m> is injective as is the composition <m>g \circ f = \braces{(1,a), (2,b)}</m>,

            Since <m>f</m> is also surjective,
            there is then an <m>x \in A</m> where <m>y = f(x)</m>.

            Suppose that <m>g \circ f</m> is surjective and consider any <m>z \in C</m> so that there is an <m>x \in A</m> where <m>(g \circ f)(x) = z</m>.
            Then we have that <m>g(f(x)) = z</m> so that
            <m>y = f(x)</m> is an element of <m>B</m> where <m>g(y) = z</m>.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>z</m> was arbitrary.

          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> need not be surjective we can use the same example sets <m>A,B,C</m> and functions <m>f,g</m> used in part<nbsp/>(c).
            It is easy to see there that
            <m>g \circ f</m> and <m>g</m> are surjective but <m>f</m> is not since there is no element of <m>A</m> that maps to <m>3 \in B</m>.

        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>f</m> has a left inverse
            <m>g: B \to A</m> so that <m>g \circ f = i_A</m>.
            Consider any <m>x,y \in A</m> where <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x = i_A(x) = (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(f(y)) = (g \circ f)(y) = i_A(y) = y \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>f</m> has a right inverse
            <m>h: B \to A</m> so that <m>f \circ h = i_B</m>.
            Consider any <m>y \in B</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>y = i_B(y) = (f \circ h)(y) = f(h(y)) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then <m>x = h(y)</m> is an element of <m>A</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> must be surjective since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) Consider the sets
          <md>
            <mrow>A \amp = \braces{1,2} \amp B \amp = \braces{a,b,c}</mrow>
          </md>
          and the function <m>f = \braces{(1,a), (2,b)}</m>.
          Define the function <m>g: B \to A</m> by <m>g = \braces{(a,1), (b,2), (c,2)}</m>.
          It is easy to see that this is a left inverse of <m>f</m> since we have
          <md>
            <mrow>(g \circ f)(1) \amp = g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1 \amp (g \circ f)(2) \amp = g(f(2)) = g(b) = 2</mrow>
          </md>
          so that <m>g \circ f = i_A</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also note that clearly <m>f</m> is not surjective since there is no element of <m>A</m> that maps to <m>c \in B</m>.
          This suffices to show that <m>f</m> cannot have a right inverse since,
          if it did,
          then it would have to be surjective by part<nbsp/>(a).
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Now define the sets
          <md>
            <mrow>A \amp = \braces{1, 2, 3} \amp B \amp = \braces{a, b}</mrow>
          </md>
          and the function <m>f = \braces{(1,a), (2,b), (3,a)}</m>.
          Define the function <m>h: B \to A</m> by <m>h = \braces{(a,1), (b,2)}</m>.
          Then we have
          <md>
            <mrow>(f \circ h)(a) \amp = f(h(a)) = f(1) = a \amp (f \circ h)(b) \amp = f(h(b)) = f(2) = b</mrow>
          </md>
          so that clearly <m>f \circ h = i_B</m>,
          and hence <m>h</m> is a right inverse of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, however,
          that <m>f</m> is not injective since <m>f(1) = a = f(3)</m>.
          This suffices to show that <m>f</m> cannot have a left inverse since,
          if it did, it would be injective by part<nbsp/>(a).
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) We claim that a function can have more than one right or left inverse.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            To show that a function can have more than one left inverse consider the example constructed in part<nbsp/>(b).
            Recall that this consists of the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>A \amp = \braces{1,2} \amp B \amp = \braces{a,b,c}</mrow>
            </md>
            and the function <m>f = \braces{(1,a), (2,b)}</m>.
            It was shown there that the function <m>g_1 = \braces{(a,1), (b,2), (c,2)}</m> is a left inverse.
            Let <m>g_2 = \braces{(a,1), (b,2), (c,1)}</m> so that clearly
            <m>g_1 \neq g_2</m> since <m>g_1(c) = 2 \neq 1 = g_2(c)</m>.
            It is trivial to show that <m>g_2</m> is also a left inverse of <m>f</m>,
            which shows that more than one left inverse exists for this <m>f</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that a function can have more than one right inverse,
            consider the example in part<nbsp/>(c), which are the sets
            <md>
              <mrow>A \amp = \braces{1, 2, 3} \amp B \amp = \braces{a, b}</mrow>
            </md>
            and the function <m>f = \braces{(1,a), (2,b), (3,a)}</m>.
            It was shown there that the function <m>h_1 = \braces{(a,1), (b,2)}</m> is a right inverse.
            Let <m>h_2 = \braces{(a,3), (b,2)}</m> so that clearly
            <m>h_1 \neq h_2</m> since <m>h_1(a) = 1 \neq 3 = h_2(a)</m>.
            However, it is trivial to show that <m>h_2</m> is also a right inverse of <m>f</m>,
            from which the desired result follows.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (e) Note that what follows proves Lemma<nbsp/>2.1 in the text,
          which is not proven there.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>f</m> has left inverse <m>g</m> and right inverse <m>h</m>.
            Then <m>f</m> must be both injective
            (since it has a left inverse)
            and surjective
            (since it has a right inverse)
            so that it is bijective by definition.
            Then of course the function <m>\ivf: B \to A</m> exists.
            Consider any <m>y \in B</m> and set
            <m>x = \ivf(y)</m> so that <m>y = f(x)</m>.
            Then we have that
            <md>
              <mrow>g(y) = g(f(x)) = (g \circ f)(x) = i_A(x) = x</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>g</m> is a left inverse of <m>f</m>.
            We also have
            <md>
              <mrow>f(h(y)) = (f \circ h)(y) = i_B(y) = y</mrow>
            </md>
            so that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(y) = \ivf(f(h(y)) = \ivf(y) = x \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>x = \ivf(y) = g(y) = h(y)</m>,
            which in turn shows that <m>\ivf = g = h</m> as desired since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: \reals \to \reals</m> be the function <m>f(x) = x^3 - x</m>.
          By restricting the domain and range of <m>f</m> appropriately,
          obtain from <m>f</m> a bijective function <m>g</m>.
          Draw the graphs of <m>g</m> and <m>\ivg</m>.
          (There are several possible choices for <m>g</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Define the subsets of the reals
          <m>A = \clop{1, \infty}</m> and <m>B = \clop{0, \infty}</m>.
          We claim that the function <m>g : A \to B</m> defined by
          <m>g(x) = f(x) = x^3 - x</m> for all <m>x \in A</m> is bijective.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we will show that <m>B</m> can even be a range for <m>g</m>,
            i.e. we must show that <m>g(x) \in B</m> for every <m>x \in A</m>,
            as this is not necessarily obvious.
            So for any <m>x \in A</m> we have that <m>x \geq 1</m>,
            and thus <m>x^2 \geq 1</m> as well.
            Then we have <m>x^2 - 1 \geq 0</m> so that the product
            <m>x(x^2 - 1) \geq 0</m> since of course <m>x \geq 1 > 0</m>.
            Therefore <m>g(x) = f(x) = x^3 - x = x(x^2 - 1) \geq 0</m> so that <m>g(x) \in B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that <m>g</m> is monotonically increasing,
            from which injectivity follows.
            Suppose that <m>x,y \in A</m> where <m>x \lt  y</m>.
            Since we have <m>x,y \geq 1 > 0</m>,
            it follows that <m>x^2 \lt  y^2</m>,
            and therefore <m>x^2 - 1 \lt  y^2 - 1</m>.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x \lt  y</mrow>
              <mrow>x(x^2-1) \leq y(x^2-1) \lt  y(y^2-1)</mrow>
              <mrow>x^3-x \lt  y^3-y</mrow>
              <mrow>g(x) \lt  g(y)</mrow>
            </md>
            since both <m>x,y \geq 1 >  0</m> and <m>x^2-1,y^2-1 \geq 0</m>.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is monotonically increasing.
            It follows that <m>g</m> is injective because,
            if we consider <m>x,y \in A</m> where <m>x \neq y</m>,
            then it has to be that either <m>x \lt  y</m> or <m>x > y</m>.
            In the former case we have <m>g(x) \lt  g(y)</m> and in the latter
            <m>g(x) > g(y)</m> so that <m>g(x) \neq g(y)</m> either way.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show that <m>g</m> is surjective in a roundabout way that depends on calculus since <m>g</m> is cubic and so does not yield a simple algebraic inverse function.
            Consider any <m>y \in B</m> so that of course <m>y \geq 0</m>.
            If <m>y = 0</m> then clearly <m>g(1) = 0 = y</m>,
            so assume that <m>y > 0</m>.
            Let <m>a_0 = \max\braces{2, y}</m> so that of course there is a real <m>a</m> such that <m>a > a_0</m> since the reals are unbounded.
            Then we of course have <m>a > a_0 \geq 2 \geq 0</m> so that <m>a \in A</m>.
            We also have
            <md>
              <mrow>a^2 > a_0^2 \geq 2^2 = 4 > 2</mrow>
              <mrow>a^2 - 1 > 1</mrow>
              <mrow>a(a^2 - 1) > a</mrow>

              <mrow>g(a) > a > a_0 \geq y \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we have that <m>g(1) = 0 \lt y \lt g(a)</m>,
            and that of course <m>1 \lt 2 \leq a_0 \lt a</m>.
            It then follows from the intermediate value theorem that there is an <m>x \in (1,a)</m> such that
            <m>f(x) = y</m> since clearly <m>g</m> is continuous by elementary calculus.
            We note that of course <m>1 \leq x</m> so that <m>x \in A</m>.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            which in turn completes the proof that <m>g</m> is a bijection.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Define two points <m>\pptp{0}</m> and
          <m>\pptp{1}</m> of the plane to be equivalent if <m>\peq{0} = \peq{1}</m>.
          Check that this is an equivalence relation and describe the equivalence classes.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we show that this relation,
          which we shall denote with <m>\sim</m>,
          is an equivalence relation.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            In what follows, suppose that <m>\pptp{0}</m>,
            <m>\pptp{1}</m>, and <m>\pptp{2}</m> are all points in the plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Reflexivity) Of course we have <m>\peq{0} = \peq{0}</m>,
            and hence <m>\pptp{0} \sim \pptp{0}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Symmetry) Suppose that <m>\pptp{0} \sim \pptp{1}</m>.
            Then we have <m>\peq{0} = \peq{1}</m> so that of course
            <m>\peq{1} = \peq{1}</m> since numerical equality is symmetric,
            and so <m>\pptp{1} \sim \pptp{0}</m> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Suppose that
            <m>\pptp{0} \sim \pptp{1}</m> and <m>\pptp{1} \sim \pptp{2}</m>.
            Then <m>\peq{0} = \peq{1}</m> and <m>\peq{1} = \peq{2}</m> so that of course
            <m>\peq{0} = \peq{2}</m> since numerical equality is transitive.
            Therefore <m>\pptp{0} \sim \pptp{2}</m>, which shows transitivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This suffices to show that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation as we set out to show.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Each equivalence class formed by this relation is the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> shifted up or down on the <m>y</m>-axis.
          This is easy to see since two points <m>\pptp{0}</m> and
          <m>\pptp{1}</m> are in the same class if <m>\peq{0}</m> and <m>\peq{1}</m> have the same value,
          say <m>c</m>.
          Then <m>\peq{0} = c</m> so that <m>y_0 = x_0^2 + c</m>,
          which is clearly such a parabola,
          and similarly <m>y_1 = x_1^2 + c</m>.

          We also note that clearly <m>C_0 \ss C</m> as well.
          Show that the restriction of an equivalence relation is an equivalence relation.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Define <m>C</m>, <m>A</m>,
            and <m>A_0</m> as above and suppose that <m>C</m> is an equivalence relation.
            Let <m>C_0 = C \cap (A_0 \times A_0)</m> be the restriction of <m>C</m> to <m>A_0</m>,
            noting that this is in fact a relation on <m>A_0</m> since clearly <m>C_0 \ss A_0 \times A_0</m>.
            Now we show that <m>C_0</m> satisfies the three properties of an equivalence relation.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Reflexivity) Consider any
            <m>a \in A_0</m> so that of course <m>(a,a) \in A_0 \times A_0</m>.
            Since <m>A_0 \ss A</m> we also have that <m>a \in A</m>.
            Hence <m>aCa</m> since <m>C</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>A</m> and is therefore reflexive.
            Thus <m>(a,a) \in C \cap (A_0 \times A_0) = C_0</m>,
            which shows that <m>a C_0 a</m> so that <m>C_0</m> is reflexive since <m>a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Symmetry) Suppose that <m>a,b \in A_0</m> and that <m>aC_0b</m>.
            Then of course <m>(b,a) \in A_0 \times A_0</m> and <m>bCa</m> since <m>C_0 \ss C</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>(b,a) \in C \cap (A_0 \times A_0) = C_0</m> so that <m>b C_0 a</m>.
            This of course shows that <m>C_0</m> is symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Now consider
            <m>a,b,c \in A_0</m> and suppose that both <m>a C_0 b</m> and <m>b C_0 c</m>.
            Then we have <m>aCb</m> and <m>bCc</m> since <m>C_0 \ss C</m>.
            Since <m>C</m> is an equivalence relation and therefore transitive,
            it follows that <m>aCc</m>,
            and since also clearly <m>(a,c) \in A_0 \times A_0</m>,
            we have <m>(a,c) \in C \cap (A_0 \times A_0) = C_0</m> so that <m>a C_0 c</m>.
            This shows that <m>C_0</m> is transitive.

          Here is a

          that every relation <m>C</m> that is both symmetric and transitive is also reflexive:
          <q>Since <m>C</m> is symmetric,
          <m>aCb</m> implies <m>bCa</m>.

        <p>
          Suppose that <m>C</m> is a relation on the set <m>A</m>.
          This argument is perfectly valid for any
          <m>a,b \in A</m> such that <m>aCb</m>,
          which is to say that we can conclude that <m>aCa</m> in this case
          (and by the same argument <m>bCb</m>).
          However, reflexivity requires <m>aCa</m> to hold for
          <em>every</em> <m>a \in A</m>.
          So if there is no <m>b \in A</m> such that <m>aCb</m> then the above argument cannot be applied and we cannot conclude that <m>aCa</m>.
          In this case the element <m>a</m> is effectively not involved in the relation at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is perhaps best illustrated with an example:
          suppose that <m>A = \braces{1,2,3,4}</m> and

        <p>
          It is easy to verify that <m>C</m> is both symmetric and transitive on <m>A</m> but it is clearly not reflexive since <m>(4,4) \notin C</m>.
          One can also observe how <m>4</m> is not involved in the relation at all and,
          if it were,
          it would have to be that <m>(4,4) \in C</m> if <m>C</m> were to remain symmetric and transitive.

          <p>
            We show the three properties necessary for <m>\sim</m> to be an equivalence relation:
          </p>
          <p>
            (Reflexivity) Consider any <m>a \in A</m> so that of course
            <m>f(a) = f(a)</m> since <m>f</m> is a function.
            Hence <m>a \sim a</m> so that <m>\sim</m> is reflexive since <m>a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Symmetry) Consider <m>a,b \in A</m> and suppose that <m>a \sim b</m>.
            Then by definition <m>f(a) = f(b)</m> so that obviously also
            <m>f(b) = f(a)</m> since equality is symmetric.
            So of course <m>b \sim a</m>,
            which shows that <m>\sim</m> is symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Consider <m>a,b,c \in A</m> and suppose that <m>a \sim b</m> and <m>b \sim c</m>.
            Then by definition <m>f(a) = f(b)</m> and
            <m>f(b) = f(c)</m> so that of course <m>f(a) = f(b) = f(c)</m>,
            and hence <m>a \sim c</m>.
            This shows that <m>\sim</m> is transitive.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Define the function <m>g: A^* \to B</m> as follows.
            For any equivalence class <m>C \in A^*</m>,
            we know that <m>C</m> is nonempty since <m>A^*</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>.
            Hence there is an <m>a \in C</m>,
            so set <m>g(C) = f(a)</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>g(C) = f(a) \in B</m> so that <m>B</m> can be the range of <m>g</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> is injective,
            consider two equivalence classes <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> where <m>g(C) = g(D)</m>.
            Then there are elements <m>c \in C</m> and <m>d \in D</m> where <m>f(c) = g(C) = g(D) = f(d)</m>.
            This shows that <m>c \sim d</m> so that they must be in the same equivalence class.
            Thus <m>d \in C</m> since <m>c \in C</m>,
            but also <m>d \in D</m> so that <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are not disjoint.
            Hence it must be that <m>C = D</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>3.1, which shows that <m>g</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> is surjective,
            consider any <m>b \in B</m>.
            Since <m>f</m> is surjective,
            there is an <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f(a) = b</m>.
            Since <m>A^*</m> is a partition,
            <m>a</m> must belong to an equivalence class <m>C \in A^*</m>.
            Then there is an element <m>c \in C</m> such that
            <m>g(C) = f(c)</m> by the definition of <m>g</m>.
            Since <m>a</m> and <m>c</m> are both in the same equivalence class <m>C</m>,
            we have that <m>a \sim c</m> so that <m>g(C) = f(c) = f(a) = b</m>.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>b \in B</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore we have shown that <m>g</m> is both injective and surjective,
            and so is a bijection by definition, as desired.

            First note that <m>S' \ss \reals \times \reals</m> and so is a relation on <m>\reals</m>.
            We show that <m>S'</m> has the three properties required of an equivalence relation.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Reflexivity) Consider any
            <m>x \in \reals</m> so that clearly <m>x - x=0</m> is an integer.
            Hence <m>(x,x) \in S'</m> by definition.
            This shows that <m>S'</m> is reflexive since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Symmetry) Suppose that <m>x,y \in \reals</m> and <m>x S' y</m>.
            Then <m>n = y - x</m> is an integer so that
            <m>x - y = -(y-x) = -n</m> is also clearly an integer.
            Therefore <m>y S' x</m> as well,
            which shows that <m>S'</m> is symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Consider <m>x,y,z \in \reals</m> and suppose that both <m>x S' y</m> and <m>y S' z</m>.
            Then <m>n = y - x</m> and <m>m = z - y</m> are both integers.
            We then have
            <md>
              <mrow>z - x = z - x + y - y = (z - y) + (y - x) = m + n \,</mrow>

            which is clearly an integer since <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are.
            Hence <m>x S' z</m> so that <m>S'</m> is transitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to show that <m>S' \sps S</m>.
            Consider any <m>\pptp{} \in S</m> so that
            <m>0 \lt x \lt 2</m> and <m>y = x + 1</m>.
            Then <m>y - x = (x + 1) - x = 1</m>,
            which is of course an integer.
            Hence <m>\pptp{} \in S'</m>,
            and thus <m>S' \sps S</m> since <m>\pptp{}</m> was arbitrary.

        <p>
          The equivalence class <m>C</m> containing

          While perhaps not immediately obvious,
          it is almost trivial to show:

          since <m>S'</m> is symmetric.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>A^*</m> be a collection of equivalence relations on <m>A</m> so that we must show that
            <m>C = \bigcap_{D \in A^*} D</m> is also an equivalence relation on <m>A</m>.
            First, suppose that any <m>\pptp{} \in C</m> and consider any
            <m>D \in A^*</m> so that <m>\pptp{} \in D</m>.
            Then also <m>\pptp{} \in A \times A</m> since <m>D</m> is a relation on <m>A</m> so that <m>D \ss A \times A</m>.
            This shows that <m>C \ss A \times A</m> since <m>\pptp{}</m> was arbitrary,
            and so <m>C</m> is a relation on <m>A</m>.
            Now we show the three required properties of an equivalence relation:
          </p>
          <p>
            (Reflexivity) Consider any <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>(x,x) \in D</m> for every
            <m>D \in A^*</m> since each <m>D</m> is an equivalence relation and so is reflexive.
            It then follows that <m>(x,x) \bigcap_{D \in A^*} D = C</m>,
            which shows that <m>C</m> is reflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Symmetric) Suppose that <m>\pptp{} \in C</m> and consider any
            <m>D \in A^*</m> so that also <m>\pptp{} \in D</m>.
            Then also <m>(y,x) \in D</m> since <m>D</m> is an equivalence relation and so is symmetric.
            Since <m>D</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>(y,x) \in \bigcap_{D \in A^*} D = C</m> so that <m>C</m> is symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Suppose that
            <m>\pptp{} \in C</m> and <m>(y,z) \in C</m>.
            For any <m>D \in A^*</m> we then have that both
            <m>\pptp{} \in D</m> and <m>(y,z) \in D</m>.
            It then follows that <m>(x,z) \in D</m> since <m>D</m> is an equivalence relation and so is transitive.
            Since <m>D</m> was arbitrary,
            we have that <m>(x,z) \in \bigcap_{D \in A^*} D = C</m> so that <m>C</m> is transitive as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c) First we note that <m>S</m> itself is <em>not</em>
          an equivalence relation on <m>\reals</m> since it is not reflexive.
          In fact <m>(x,x) \notin S</m> for any
          <m>x \in \reals</m> since it is never true that <m>x = x+1</m>.
          Now define the following subsets of the plane:
          <md>
            <mrow>S_1 \amp = \braces{\pptp{} \where y = x} \amp S_4 \amp = \braces{\pptp{} \where y = x + 2 \text{ and }  0 \lt  x \lt  1}</mrow>
            <mrow>S_2 \amp = S = \braces{\pptp{} \where y = x + 1 \text{ and }  0 \lt  x \lt  2} \amp S_5 \amp = \braces{\pptp{} \where y = x - 2 \text{ and }  2 \lt  x \lt  3} \,.</mrow>
            <mrow>S_3 \amp = \braces{\pptp{} \where y = x - 1 \text{ and }  1 \lt  x \lt  3}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We then claim that the intersection we seek is <m>T = \bigcup_{i \in \intsfin{5}} S_i</m>.

            <m>R \in S^*</m> so that <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\reals</m> that contains <m>S</m>.
            We then have the following cases:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_1</m>.
            Then of course <m>y = x</m> so that
            <m>\pptp{} = (x,x) \in R</m> since it is an equivalence relation and thus reflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_2 = S</m>.
            Then of course <m>\pptp{} \in R</m> since <m>R</m> contains <m>S</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_3</m>.
            Then we have that <m>y = x - 1</m> with <m>1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
            from which it follows that
            <m>x = y + 1</m> and <m>0 \lt y = x-1 \lt 2</m>.
            Therefore <m>(y,x) \in S</m> so that
            <m>(y,x) \in R</m> since <m>R</m> contains <m>S</m>.
            We then have that <m>\pptp{} \in R</m> as well since <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation and therefore symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_4</m>.
            Then <m>y = x+2</m> with <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>.
            Let <m>z = x+1</m> so that
            <m>(x,z) \in S = S_4</m> since we also have <m>0 \lt x \lt 1 \lt 2</m>.
            We then know that <m>(x,z) \in R</m> since <m>R</m> contains <m>S</m>.
            We also then have that <m>y = x+2 = (x+1)+1 = z+1</m> with
            <m>0 \lt 1 \lt z = x+1 \lt 2</m> since <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>.
            Thus <m>(z,y) \in S = S_4</m> so that also <m>(z,y) \in R</m>.
            Since <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation and therefore transitive,
            we have that <m>\pptp{} \in R</m> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_5</m>.
            Then we have <m>y = x-2</m> and <m>2 \lt x \lt 3</m>.
            It then follows that <m>x = y+2</m> and
            <m>0 \lt y = x-2 \lt 1</m> so that <m>(y,x) \in S_4</m>.
            Then of course <m>(y,x) \in R</m> by the previous case so that also
            <m>\pptp{} \in R</m> since <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation and therefore symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in every case <m>\pptp{} \in R</m> so that also
            <m>\pptp{} \in \bigcap_{R \in S^*} R</m> since <m>R</m> was arbitrary.
            It then follows that <m>T \ss \bigcap_{R \in S^*} R</m> since <m>\pptp{}</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> All we really need to show is that <m>T</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>\reals</m> that contains <m>S</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>T \in S^*</m> so that of course <m>T \sps \bigcap_{R \in S^*} R</m>.
            First we note that clearly
            <m>T \ss \reals^2</m> so that it is a relation on <m>\reals</m>.
            Also clearly it contains <m>S</m> since <m>S = S_2 \ss T</m>.
            Now we show that it has the three properties that an equivalence relation require.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Reflexivity) For any <m>x \in \reals</m> clearly
            <m>(x,x) \in S_1 \ss T</m> so that <m>T</m> is reflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Symmetry) Suppose that <m>xTy</m> so that <m>\pptp{} \in T</m>.
            We then have the following cases:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_1</m>.
            Then of course <m>y = x</m> so <m>(y,x) = (x,x) = \pptp{} \in S_1 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_2 = S</m>.
            Then <m>y = x+1</m> and <m>0\lt x\lt 2</m> so that <m>x = y-1</m> and <m>1 \lt y=x+1 \lt 3</m>.
            Hence <m>(y,x) \in S_3 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_3</m>.
            Then we have that <m>y = x - 1</m> with <m>1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
            from which it follows that
            <m>x = y + 1</m> and <m>0 \lt y = x-1 \lt 2</m>.
            Therefore <m>(y,x) \in S = S_2 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_4</m>.
            Then <m>y = x+2</m> with <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m> so that <m>x = y-2</m> and <m>2 \lt y=x+2 \lt 3</m>.
            Hence <m>(y,x) \in S_5 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_5</m>.
            Then we have <m>y = x-2</m> and
            <m>2 \lt x \lt 3</m> so that <m>x = y+2</m> and <m>0 \lt y=x-2 \lt 1</m>.
            Hence <m>(y,x) \in S_4 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in all cases <m>(y,x) \in T</m>,
            which shows that <m>T</m> is symmetric.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Now suppose that <m>xTy</m> and <m>yTz</m>.
            If <m>x = y</m> then of course we have <m>(x,z) = (y,z) \in T</m>.
            Similarly if <m>y = z</m> then <m>(x,z) = \pptp{} \in T</m>.
            So assume that <m>x \neq y</m> and
            <m>y \neq z</m> so that it can neither be that
            <m>\pptp{} \in S_1</m> nor <m>(y,z) \in S_1</m>.
            Thus there are four sets (i.e.
            <m>S_i</m> where <m>i \in \braces{2,3,4,5}</m>) that <m>\pptp{}</m> and <m>(y,z)</m> can be in,
            which results in sixteen different possibilities,
            though not all are possible:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_2</m>.
            Then <m>y=x+1</m> and <m>0 \lt x \lt 2</m> so that
            <m>1 \lt y = x+1 \lt 3</m>. \begin{indpar} Case:
            <m>(y,z) \in S_2</m>.
            Then also <m>z=y+1</m> and
            <m>0 \lt y \lt 2</m> so that <m>z = y+1 = (x+1)+1 = x+2</m> and
            <m>y = x+1 \lt 2</m> means that <m>x \lt 1</m>.
            Hence <m>z = x+2</m> and <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m> so that <m>(x,z) \in S_4 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_3</m>.
            Then <m>z = y-1</m> and <m>1 \lt y \lt 3</m> so that <m>z = y-1 = (x+1)-1 = x</m>,
            and hence <m>(x,z) = (x,x) \in S_1 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_4</m>.
            This case is not possible because
            <m>1 \lt y \lt 3</m> so that it cannot be that
            <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m> and hence <m>(y,z)</m> cannot be in <m>S_4</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_5</m>.
            Then <m>z = y-2</m> and <m>2 \lt y \lt 3</m> so that <m>z = y-2 = (x+1)-2 = x-1</m> and
            <m>2 \lt y = x+1 \lt 3</m> means that <m>1 \lt x \lt 2 \lt 3</m>.
            Hence <m>z=x-1</m> and <m>1 \lt x \lt 3</m> so that <m>(x,z) \in S_3 \ss T</m>. \end{indpar}
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_3</m>.
            Then <m>y=x-1</m> and <m>1 \lt x \lt 3</m> so that

            Then <m>z = y+1</m> and <m>0 \lt y \lt 2</m> so that
            <m>z = y+1 = (x-1)+1 = x</m> and hence <m>(x,z) = (x,x) \in S_1 \ss T</m>.

            <m>1 \lt y = x-1</m> and hence <m>2 \lt x</m>.
            Therefore <m>z = x-2</m> and
            <m>2 \lt x \lt 3</m> so that <m>(x,z) \in S_5 \ss T</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_4</m>.
            Then <m>z=y+2</m> and <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m> so that <m>z = y+2 = (x-1)+2 = x+1</m> and
            <m>y = x-1 \lt 1</m> and hence <m>x \lt 2</m>.
            Thus <m>z = x+1</m> and <m>0 \lt 1 \lt x \lt 2</m> so that <m>(x,z) \in S_2 \ss T</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_5</m>.
            This is case is not possible because <m>y \lt 2</m> so that it cannot be that <m>2 \lt y \lt 3</m>,
            and hence <m>(y,z)</m> cannot be in <m>S_5</m>. \end{indpar}

            This case is also impossible because <m>2 \lt y</m> so that it cannot be that <m>0 \lt y \lt 2</m>,

            Thus <m>z = x+1</m> and <m>0 \lt x \lt 2</m> so that <m>(x,z) \in S_2 \ss T</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_4</m>.
            This case is not possible because again <m>2 \lt y</m> so that it cannot be that <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m>,

          <p>
            Case: <m>(y,z) \in S_5</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>\pptp{} \in S_5</m>.
            Then <m>y=x-2</m> and <m>2 \lt x \lt 3</m> so that

          <p>
            Thus in every case that is actually possible we have that <m>(x,z) \in T</m>,
            which shows that <m>T</m> is transitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore <m>T</m> is an equivalence relation that contains <m>S</m> so that <m>T \sps \bigcap_{R \in S^*} R</m> as discussed above,
            which of course completes the proof that <m>T = \bigcap_{R \in S^*} R</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          As far as the equivalence classes formed by <m>T</m> are concerned,
          refer to the illustration above.
          Consider the equivalence class <m>C</m> contains <m>x \in \reals</m>.
          If <m>x \leq 0</m> or <m>x \geq 3</m> then
          <m>C = \braces{x}</m> because there is no other <m>y</m> for which <m>yTx</m> except <m>y=x</m>.
          So suppose that <m>0 \lt  x \lt  3</m>.
          If <m>x</m> is an integer so that <m>x = 1</m> or <m>x = 2</m>,
          then <m>C = \braces{1,2}</m>.
          If <m>x</m> is not an integer,
          then <m>C</m> always has three elements.
          We have that
          <md>
            <mrow>C = \begin{cases}\braces{x, x+1, x+2} \amp  0 \lt  x \lt  1 \\ \braces{x-1, x, x+1} \amp  1 \lt  x \lt  2 \\ \braces{x-2, x-1, x} \amp  2 \lt  x \lt  3 \end{cases}  \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These facts can be deduced by examining where the vertical line intersecting the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x</m> intersects the graph of <m>T</m>.

        <p>
          First we show that <m>\lt</m> is an order relation on the plane.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As clearly <m>\lt</m> is a relation on the plane,
            we need only show that it has the three required properties of an order relation:
          </p>
          <p>
            (Comparability) Consider distinct <m>\pptp{0}</m> and
            <m>\pptp{1}</m> in the plane so that either
            <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m> or <m>y_0 \neq y_1</m>.
            Obviously if <m>\peq{0} \lt  \peq{1}</m>
            (or <m>\peq{1} \lt  \peq{0}</m>)
            then of course <m>\pptp{0} \lt  \pptp{1}</m>
            (or <m>\pptp{1} \lt  \pptp{0}</m>)

            which is a contradiction.
            So it must be that <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m>.

          Geometrically,
          we refer back to Exercise<nbsp/>3.1 and consider a parabola <m>y = x^2</m> shifted up or down on the <m>y</m>-axis be some amount <m>c</m>.
          Then <m>y = x^2 + c</m> so that <m>\peq{} = c</m>,
          and hence every <m>\pptp{}</m> point on the parabola has the same value for <m>\peq{}</m>,
          namely <m>c</m>.
          Therefore if two distinct points <m>\pptp{0}</m> and
          <m>\pptp{1}</m> lie on the different parabolas then <m>\peq{0}</m> and <m>\peq{1}</m> will have different values,
          say <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>, respectively.
          Then clearly if <m>\pptp{1}</m> is on a higher parabola on the <m>y</m>-axis then <m>c \lt d</m> so that
          <m>\peq{0} = c \lt d = \peq{1}</m> so that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m> in our order.
          If the points lie on the same parabola then
          <m>\peq{0} = \peq{1}</m> and whichever points is further to the right will be larger in our order since then,
          for example,
          <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m> so that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.

          Show that the restriction of an order relation is an order relation.

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is a set with order relation <m>\lt</m>.
            Also let <m>A_0</m> be a subset of <m>A</m> so that
            <m>\prec = \lt \cap (A_0 \times A_0)</m> is the restriction of <m>\lt</m> to <m>A_0</m>.
            Clearly <m>\prec \ss A_0 \times A_0</m> so that it s a relation on <m>A_0</m>.
            So we must show that <m>\prec</m> satisfies the three properties of an order relation:
          </p>
          <p>
            (Comparability) Consider any <m>x,y \in A_0</m> so that also
            <m>x,y \in A</m> since <m>A_0 \ss A</m>.
            Then <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable in <m>\lt</m> since it is an order.
            So, without loss of generality,
            we can assume that <m>x \lt y</m> and so <m>(x,y) \in \lt</m>.
            Since clearly also <m>(x,y) \in A_0 \times A_0</m>,
            it follows that <m>(x,y) \in \lt \cap (A_0 \times A_0) = \prec</m> and hence <m>x \prec y</m>.
            This shows that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Nonreflexivity) Suppose that
            <m>x \in A_0</m> so that also <m>x \in A</m> since <m>A_0 \ss A</m>.
            Then it cannot be true that <m>x \lt x</m> since <m>A</m> is an order and so is nonreflexive.
            Thus <m>(x,x) \notin \lt</m> so that also <m>(x,x) \notin \lt \cap (A_0 \times A_0) = \prec</m>.
            Hence it is not true that <m>x \prec x</m> so that <m>\prec</m> is also nonreflexive since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Suppose that
            <m>x \prec y</m> and <m>y \prec z</m>.
            Then of course <m>(x,y) \in A_0 \times A_0</m> and <m>(x,y) \in \lt</m>,
            and similarly <m>(y,z) \in A_0 \times A_0</m> and <m>(y,z) \in \lt</m>.
            Hence <m>x \lt y</m> and <m>y \lt z</m> so that <m>x \lt z</m> since <m>\lt</m> is an order and therefore transitive.
            Thus <m>(x,z) \in \lt</m> so that
            <m>(x,z) \in \lt \cap (A_0 \times A_0) = \prec</m> since clearly <m>(x,z) \in A_0 \times A_0</m>.
            So then <m>x \prec z</m>, which shows that <m>\prec</m> is transitive.

            We show that this satisfies the three properties of an order:

            (or <m>yCx</m>)
            so we are done.
            So assume that <m>x^2 = y^2</m>.
            Since we know that <m>x \neq y</m>,
            it has to be that <m>y = -x</m> so that still <m>x^2 = y^2</m>.
            This also implies that <m>x,y \neq 0</m> since otherwise we would have <m>0 = y = -x = 0 = x</m>.
            If <m>x > 0</m> then we have <m>y = -x \lt 0 \lt x</m>.
            If <m>x \lt 0</m> then we have <m>x \lt 0 \lt -x = y</m>.

            (or <m>yCx</m>).
            This shows that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable in <m>C</m>.

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Clearly <m>\lt</m> is a relation on
            <m>A \times B</m> so we just need to show the three properties of an order relation:
          </p>
          <p>
            (Comparability) Consider distinct points <m>\appt{1}</m> and
            <m>\appt{2}</m> in <m>A \times B</m> so that
            <m>a_1 \neq a_2</m> or <m>b_1 \neq b_1</m>.
            If <m>a_1 \neq a_2</m> then they are comparable in <m>\lt _A</m>
            (since it is an order relation)
            so that, without loss of generality,
            we can assume that <m>a_1 \lt _A a_2</m>.
            Then of course <m>\appt{1} \lt \appt{2}</m> by definition.
            So assume that <m>a_1 = a_2</m> so that it must be that <m>b_1 \neq b_2</m>.
            Then <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> are comparable in <m>\lt _B</m> since it is an order relation.
            So without loss of generality we can assume that <m>b_1 \lt _B b_2</m>.
            Then of course <m>\appt{1} \lt \appt{2}</m> since also <m>a_1 = a_2</m>.
            Thus either way <m>\appt{1}</m> and
            <m>\appt{2}</m> are comparable in <m>\lt</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Nonreflexivity) Suppose that <m>\appt{}</m> is any element of <m>A \times B</m>.
            Since <m>\lt _B</m> is an order relation,
            it is nonreflexive so that it is not true that <m>b \lt _B b</m>.
            Since of course <m>a=a</m>,
            it follows that it cannot be that
            <m>\appt{} \lt \appt{}</m> since it would have to be that <m>b \lt _B b</m>.
            Hence <m>\lt</m> is nonreflexive since <m>\appt{}</m> was arbitrary.

            <m>\appt{1} \lt \appt{2}</m> and <m>\appt{2} \lt \appt{3}</m>.
            We then have the following cases:

            Case: <m>x \geq 0</m>.
            Then also <m>y > 0</m> since <m>y > x \geq 0</m>.

            since <m>x \lt  y</m> and <m>1/(1-x^2)</m> and <m>1/(1-y^2)</m> are both positive.

          <p>
            Case: <m>x \lt 0</m>.
            Then <m>f(x) = x/(1-x^2) \lt 0</m> since <m>x\lt 0</m> and

            Then we have that <m>-x > -y \geq 0</m> so that
            <m>f(-y) \lt f(-x)</m> by the previous case.
            But we have <m>f(-x) = -x/(1-(-x)^2) = -x/(1-x^2) = -f(x)</m>,
            and similarly <m>f(-y) = -f(y)</m>.
            Hence <m>-f(y) = f(-y) \lt f(-x) = -f(x)</m> so that <m>f(y) > f(x)</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>y > 0</m>.

            so that <m>g(y)</m> is well-defined for all
            <m>y \in \reals</m> since the denominator of <m>g(y)</m> is always nonzero.
            Now, if <m>y = 0</m> then clearly <m>\abs{g(y)} = \abs{g(0)} = \abs{0} = 0 \lt  1</m>.
            So in what follows assume that

            so that <m>-1 \lt  g(y) \lt  1</m> and hence <m>g(y) \in (-1,1)</m>.

            First let <m>a</m> be an element of <m>A</m> and suppose that <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> are both immediate successors of <m>a</m>,
            which of course means that <m>a \lt b_1,b_2</m>.
            Then by definition the open intervals <m>(a,b_1)</m> and <m>(a,b_2)</m> are both empty.
            Now, suppose that <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> are distinct so that they must be comparable since <m>\lt</m> is an order.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that <m>b_1 \lt b_2</m>,

            This is a contradiction since we know that <m>(a,b_2)</m> is empty,
            so it has to be that <m>b_1 = b_2</m>.
            This of course shows that the immediate successor is unique.

          <p>
            This may seem fairly obvious but we show it formally anyway.
            Suppose that <m>\lt _A</m> and <m>\lt _B</m> are the orders on <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
            respectively.
            Let <m>a</m> be the smallest element of <m>A</m> and suppose to the contrary that they <em>do</em>
            have the same order type.
            Then there is a bijection <m>f: A \to B</m> that preserves order,
            noting that <m>\inv{f}</m> is also then a bijection.
            Now, since <m>B</m> has no smallest element,
            there must be a <m>b \in B</m> where <m>b \lt _B f(a)</m>.
            Setting <m>a' = \inv{f}(b)</m> so that
            <m>f(a') = b</m> we have that <m>f(a') = b \lt _B f(a)</m>,
            and hence it has to be that
            <m>a' \lt _A a</m> since otherwise we'd have
            <m>a \leq_A a'</m> so that <m>f(a) \leq_B f(a')</m>.
            However, <m>a' \lt a</m> means that it is not true that
            <m>a \leq a'</m> by <xref ref="lem_relations_lngeq">Lemma</xref>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m>.
            Therefore it must be that no such <m>f</m> exists so that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have different order types.

          <p>
            First consider any point <m>\pptp{1} \in \pintss</m> where
            <m>\pptp{1} \notin A</m> so that <m>y_0 \neq 1</m>.
            It then follows that <m>y_1 > 1</m> since <m>1</m> is the smallest positive integer.
            Then set <m>x_0 = x_1</m> and <m>y_0 = y_1 - 1</m> so that clearly
            <m>\pptp{0} \in \pintss</m> since <m>y_0 > 0</m> because <m>y_1 > 1</m>.
            Clearly also <m>x_0 = x_1</m> and <m>y_0 \lt y_1</m> so that
            <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m> in the dictionary order.
            We claim that <m>\pptp{0}</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            So suppose to the contrary that there is an
            <m>\pptp{2} \in \pintss</m> such that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>x_0 \lt x_2</m> since then we would have
            <m>x_1 = x_0 \lt x_2</m> so that <m>\pptp{1} \lt \pptp{2}</m>,
            which by <xref ref="lem_relations_lngeq">Lemma</xref>
            contradicts the fact that <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            So it has to be that <m>x_0 = x_2</m> and <m>y_0 \lt y_2</m>.
            Since then <m>x_2 = x_0 = x_1</m>,
            it must also be that <m>y_2 \lt y_1</m> since <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            But then we have <m>y_0 \lt y_2 \lt y_1 = y_0+1</m>,
            which is not possible since
            <m>y_1 = y_0+1</m> is the immediate successor of <m>y_0</m> in <m>\pints</m> so that there can be no integers between them.
            So it must be that no <m>\pptp{2}</m> exists so that
            <m>\pptp{0}</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            Thus every element not in <m>A</m> has an immediate predecessor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\pptp{1} \in A</m> so that <m>y_1 = 1</m>,
            and consider any point <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>x_0 = x_1</m> since then we would have <m>y_0 \lt y_1 = 1</m>,
            which is not possible since <m>1</m> is the smallest positive integer.
            So it must be that <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m>.
            Then let <m>x_2 = x_0</m> and <m>y_2 = y_0+1</m> so that clearly
            <m>\pptp{2} \in \pintss</m> since <m>y+1</m> is always still a positive integer if <m>y</m> is.
            Then we have that <m>x_0 = x_2</m> and <m>y_0 \lt y_0 + 1 = y_2</m>,
            and hence <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2}</m>.
            We also have <m>x_2 = x_0 \lt x_1</m> so that <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Therefore <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>,
            which shows that <m>\pptp{0}</m> is not the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            This shows that <m>\pptp{1}</m> has no immediate predecessor since <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m> was arbitrary.
            Since <m>\pptp{1} \in A</m> was arbitrary,
            this completes the proof that every element in <m>\pintss</m> has an immediate predecessor except those in <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to prove that <m>(1,1)</m> is the smallest element in the dictionary order.
            Consider any <m>\pptp{0} \in \pintss</m> and suppose that <m>\pptp{0} \lt (1,1)</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>x_0 \lt 1</m> since <m>1</m> is the smallest positive integer.
            So then <m>x_0 = 1</m> and <m>y_0 \lt 1</m>,
            but this is also not possible,
            again since <m>1</m> is the smallest positive integer.
            Thus it cannot be that <m>\pptp{0} \lt (1,1)</m>,
            so it must be that <m>(1,1) \leq \pptp{0}</m> by <xref ref="lem_relations_lngeq">Lemma</xref>.
            This shows that <m>(1,1)</m> is the smallest element since <m>\pptp{0}</m> was arbitrary.

          We claim that every element has an immediate predecessor except those in the subset
          <md>
            <mrow>A = \braces{\pptp{} \where x=1 \text{ or }  y=1} \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also claim that the set <m>\pintss</m> has no smallest element in this order.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>\pptp{1} \notin A</m> so that
            <m>x_1 \neq 1</m> and <m>y_1 \neq 1</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>x_1,y_1 > 1</m>.
            So set <m>\pptp{0} = (x_1-1,y_1-1)</m> so that clearly still <m>\pptp{0} \in \pintss</m>.
            Then <m>x_0-y_0 = (x_1-1)-(y_1-1) = x_1-1-y_1+1 = x_1-y_1</m>.
            We also have <m>y_0 = y_1-1 \lt y_1</m> so that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Now suppose that there is an
            <m>\pptp{2} \in \pintss</m> where <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>x_0-y_0 \lt x_2-y_2</m> since then we would have
            <m>x_1-y_1 = x_0-y_0 \lt x_2-y_2</m> so that <m>\pptp{1} \lt \pptp{2}</m>,
            which we know cannot be the case since <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            So it must be that <m>x_2-y_2 = x_0-y_0 = x_1-y_1</m> and <m>y_0 \lt y_2</m>,
            but then we must have <m>y_0 \lt y_2 \lt y_1 = y_0+1</m>,
            noting that <m>y_2 \lt y_1</m> because
            <m>x_2-y_2 = x_1-y_1</m> and <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            However, this is not possible since of course <m>y_0+1</m> is the immediate successor of <m>y_0</m> in <m>\pints</m>.
            So then it has to be that no such <m>\pptp{2}</m> exists so that
            <m>\pptp{0}</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            This shows that every point not in <m>A</m> has an immediate predecessor since <m>\pptp{1}</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>\pptp{1} \in A</m> so that <m>x_1 = 1</m> or <m>y_1 = 1</m>,
            and consider any <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x_1 = 1</m>.
            Suppose that <m>x_0-y_0 = x_1-y_1</m> and <m>y_0 \lt y_1</m>.
            Then we would have <m>-y_0 > -y_1</m> and
            <m>x_0-y_0 = x_1-y_1 = 0 - y_1 = -y_1 \lt -y_0</m> so that <m>x_0 \lt 0</m>
            (by adding <m>y_0</m> to both sides),
            which is not possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>y_1 = 1</m>.
            It clearly cannot be that case that
            <m>x_0-y_0 = x_1-y_1</m> and <m>y_0 \lt y_1</m> since then
            <m>y_0 \lt y_1 = 1</m>, which is not possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in either case it must be that
            <m>x_0-y_0 \lt x_1-y_1</m> since <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            So set the point <m>\pptp{2} = (x_0+1,y_0+1)</m>,
            which is clearly still an element of <m>\pintss</m>.
            We then have <m>x_2-y_2 = (x_0+1)-(y_0+1) = x_0+1-y_0-1 = x_0-y_0 \lt x_1-y_1</m> so that <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            We also have <m>x_0-y_0 = x_2-y_2</m> and
            <m>y_0 \lt y_0+1 = y_2</m> so that also <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2}</m>.
            Hence <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m> so that
            <m>\pptp{0}</m> is not the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            Since <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\pptp{1}</m> has no immediate predecessor at all.
            Since <m>\pptp{1} \in A</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that no element of <m>A</m> has an immediate predecessor.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>\pints</m> in this order has no smallest element,
            consider absolutely any <m>\pptp{1} \in \pintss</m>.
            Let <m>\pptp{0} = (x_1,y_1+1)</m> so that of course <m>\pptp{0} \in \pintss</m>.
            We then have that <m>x_0 - y_0 = x_1 - (y_1+1) = (x_1 - y_1) - 1 \lt x_1 - y_1</m> so that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Then of course is it not true that
            <m>\pptp{1} \leq \pptp{0}</m> by <xref ref="lem_relations_lngeq">Lemma</xref>
            so that <m>\pptp{1}</m> cannot be the smallest element.
            Then, since <m>\pptp{1}</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\pintss</m> has no smallest element in this order.

        <p>
          We claim that every element has an immediate predecessor except for <m>(1,1)</m>,
          which is the smallest element.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>\pptp{0} = (1,1)</m> is the smallest element,
            from which it follows that it cannot have an immediate predecessor since it has no predecessors at all.
            Consider any <m>\pptp{1}</m> in <m>\pintss</m>.
            If <m>\pptp{1} = (1,1)</m> then of course <m>\pptp{0} = (1,1) \leq \pptp{1}</m> is true,
            so assume that <m>\pptp{1} \neq (1,1)</m> so that either
            <m>x_1 \neq 1</m> or <m>y_1 \neq 1</m>.
            If <m>x_1 \neq 1</m> then it has to be that <m>x_1 > 1</m> so that <m>x_0 + y_0 = 1 + 1 \leq 1 + y_1 \lt x_1 + y_1</m>,
            and hence <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            If <m>y_1 \neq 1</m> then <m>y_1 > 1</m> so that again <m>x_0 + y_0 = 1 + 1 \leq x_1 + 1 \lt x_1 + y_1</m>,
            and hence <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Thus in every case <m>\pptp{0} \leq \pptp{1}</m>,
            which shows that <m>\pptp{0} = (1,1)</m> is the smallest element since <m>\pptp{1}</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that every other element of <m>\pints</m> has an immediate predecessor in this order.
            So consider any <m>\pptp{1} \in \pintss</m> where <m>\pptp{1} \neq (1,1)</m>.
            Hence either <m>x_1 \neq 1</m> or <m>y_1 \neq 1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>y_1 = 1</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>x_1 \neq 1</m> so that <m>x_1 > 1</m>.
            We claim that <m>\pptp{0} = (1, x_1-1)</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            First we note that clearly
            <m>\pptp{0} \in \pintss</m> since <m>x_1 > 1</m>.
            We also have that <m>x_0 + y_0 = 1 + x_1 - 1 = x_1 \lt x_1 + y_1</m> since <m>0 \lt 1 = y_1</m>,
            and so <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Now suppose that there is a point
            <m>\pptp{2} \in \pintss</m> where <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>x_1+y_1 = x_2+y_2</m> and
            <m>y_1 \lt y_2</m> because then we would have <m>y_2 \lt y_1 = 1</m>,
            which is not possible since <m>y_2 \in \pints</m>.
            So it must be that <m>x_2+y_2 \lt x_1+y_1 = x_1+1</m> since <m>\pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Now, since also <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2}</m>,
            it must be that <m>x_0+y_0 \leq x_2+y_2</m>,
            but then we have <m>x_1 = 1 + (x_1 - 1) = x_0 + y_0 \leq x_2+y_2 \lt x_1+1</m>,
            which is impossible.
            So it has to be that no such <m>\pptp{2}</m> exists so that
            <m>\pptp{0}</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>y_1 \neq 1</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>y_1 > 1</m> so that the point
            <m>\pptp{0} = (x_1+1,y_1-1)</m> is still an element of <m>\pintss</m>.
            We show that <m>\pptp{0}</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
            First we have that <m>x_0+y_0 = (x_1+1) + (y_1-1) = x_1 + y_1</m> and
            <m>y_0 = y_1-1 \lt y_1</m> so that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Now suppose that there a point
            <m>\pptp{2} \in \pintss</m> where <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>x_0 + y_0 \leq x_2+y_2 \leq x_1+y_1</m> so that we have
            <m>x_1+y_1 = (x_1+1)+(y_1-1) = x_0+y_0 \leq x_2+y_2 \leq x_1+y_1</m> so that <m>x_0+y_0 = x_2+y_2 = x_1+y_1</m>.
            But then we must have <m>y_1 - 1 = y_0 \lt y_2 \lt y_1</m>,
            which is not possible since <m>y_1-1</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>y_1</m> in <m>\pints</m>.
            So no such <m>\pptp{2}</m> can exists,
            and hence <m>\pptp{0}</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\pptp{1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This in all cases <m>\pptp{1}</m> has an immediate predecessor,
            which shows the desired result since <m>\pptp{1} \neq (1,1)</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now we show that all three orders have different order types.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            It follows immediately from <xref ref="lem_relations_otsmallest">Lemma</xref>
            that order (i) and order (ii) do not have the same order type since (i) has a smallest element while (ii) does not.
            Similarly order (iii) and order (ii) cannot have the same order type for the same reason.
            So all that remains to be shown is that orders (i) and (iii) have different order types.
          </p>
          <p>
            So denote order (i) with <m>\lt</m> and order (iii) with <m>\prec</m> and suppose to the contrary that they do have the same order type.
            Then there is a bijection <m>f: \pintss \to \pintss</m> that preserves order,
            supposing that the domain has the dictionary order <m>\lt</m> and the range has the order <m>\prec</m>.
            Then of course <m>\inv{f}</m> is also a bijection that preserves order.
            It was shown above that <m>\pintss</m> with <m>\lt</m> has countably many elements with no immediate predecessor,
            whereas <m>\pintss</m> with <m>\prec</m> has only a single such element,
            namely the smallest element <m>(1,1)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we can choose an element
            <m>\pptp{1}</m> of <m>\pintss</m> that has no immediate predecessor in <m>\lt</m> but also such that <m>f\pptp{1} \neq (1,1)</m> so that
            <m>f\pptp{1}</m> does have an immediate predecessor in <m>\prec</m>.
            So let <m>(u_0, v_0)</m> be the immediate predecessor of
            <m>f\pptp{1}</m> in <m>\prec</m> and set
            <m>\pptp{0} = \inv{f}(u_0,v_0)</m> so that <m>(u_0,v_0) = f\pptp{0}</m>.
            Then of course <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{1}</m> since
            <m>f\pptp{0} = (u_0,v_0) \prec f\pptp{1}</m> and <m>f</m> preserves order.
            But since <m>\pptp{1}</m> has no immediate predecessor in <m>\lt</m>,
            there is a point <m>\pptp{2}</m> such that <m>\pptp{0} \lt \pptp{2} \lt \pptp{1}</m>.
            We then have that <m>(u_0,v_0) = f\pptp{0} \prec f\pptp{2} \prec f\pptp{1}</m> since <m>f</m> preserves order,
            which is a contradiction since
            <m>(u_0,v_0)</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>f\pptp{1}</m>.
            So it must be that no such order-preserving <m>f</m> exists and hence the two orders do not have the same order type.

        <statement>
          <p>
            If an ordered set <m>A</m> has the least upper bound property,
            then it has the greatest lower bound property.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A_0</m> is any nonempty subset of <m>A</m> that is bounded below so that <m>b</m> is a lower bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            Let <m>B_0</m> be the set of lower bounds of <m>A_0</m> so that <m>B_0</m> is nonempty since <m>b \in B_0</m>.
            Since <m>A_0</m> is nonempty there is an <m>a \in A_0</m>.
            Now, for any <m>x \in B_0</m> we have that <m>x</m> is a lower bound of <m>A_0</m> so that <m>x \leq a</m>,
            which shows that <m>a</m> is an upper bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Hence <m>B_0</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>A</m> that is bounded above,
            and so has a least upper bound <m>c</m> since <m>A</m> has the least upper bound property.
            We claim that <m>c</m> is also the greatest lower bound of <m>A_0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in A_0</m> and any <m>y \in B_0</m>.
            Then <m>y</m> is a lower bound of <m>A_0</m> so that
            <m>y \leq x</m> since <m>x \in A_0</m>.
            Since <m>y \in B_0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>x</m> is an upper bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Thus we have <m>c \leq x</m> since <m>c</m> is the least upper bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Since <m>x \in A_0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>c</m> is a lower bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            If <m>y</m> is any other lower bound then <m>y \in B_0</m> so that
            <m>y \leq c</m> since <m>c</m> is an upper bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was an arbitrary lower bound,
            this shows that in fact <m>c</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            Hence <m>A</m> also has the greatest lower bound property since the nonempty subset <m>A_0</m> was arbitrary.

          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that <m>C</m> is symmetric.
            Then we simply have

        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>C</m> is an order relation.
            Since clearly <m>D</m> is a relation on <m>A</m>,
            we need only show that it has the three required properties:
          </p>
          <p>
            (Comparability) Consider any distinct
            <m>a,b \in A</m> so that <m>aCb</m> or <m>bCa</m> since <m>C</m> has comparability.
            Hence either <m>bDa</m> or <m>aDb</m>, respectively,
            by definition so that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are comparable in <m>D</m> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Nonreflexivity) Consider any <m>a \in A</m>.
            Then <m>(a,a) \notin C</m> since it is nonreflexive,
            thus also <m>(a,a) \notin D</m> since, if it were,
            it would also be that <m>(a,a) \in C</m> by definition.
            Hence <m>D</m> is also nonreflexive since <m>a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Transitivity) Suppose that <m>aDb</m> and <m>bDc</m>.
            Then by definition we have <m>bCa</m> and <m>cCb</m>.
            That is, <m>cCb</m> and <m>bCa</m> so that <m>cCa</m> since <m>C</m> is transitive.
            Therefore <m>aDc</m> by definition,
            which shows that <m>D</m> is also transitive.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c) The converse follows from an argument directly analogous to the proof of Exercise<nbsp/>3.13,
          which we give here for completeness.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> has the greatest lower bound property and that <m>A_0</m> is any nonempty subset of <m>A</m> that is bounded above so that <m>b</m> is an upper lower bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            Let <m>B_0</m> be the set of upper bounds of <m>A_0</m> so that <m>B_0</m> is nonempty since <m>b \in B_0</m>.
            Since <m>A_0</m> is nonempty there is an <m>a \in A_0</m>.
            Now, for any <m>x \in B_0</m> we have that <m>x</m> is an upper bound of <m>A_0</m> so that <m>a \leq x</m>,
            which shows that <m>a</m> is a lower bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Hence <m>B_0</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>A</m> that is bounded below,
            and so has a greatest lower bound <m>c</m> since <m>A</m> has the greatest lower bound property.
            We claim that <m>c</m> is also the least upper bound of <m>A_0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>x \in A_0</m> and any <m>y \in B_0</m>.
            Then <m>y</m> is an upper bound of <m>A_0</m> so that
            <m>x \leq y</m> since <m>x \in A_0</m>.
            Since <m>y \in B_0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>x</m> is a lower bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Thus we have <m>x \leq c</m> since <m>c</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Since <m>x \in A_0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>c</m> is an upper bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            If <m>y</m> is any other upper bound then <m>y \in B_0</m> so that
            <m>c \leq y</m> since <m>c</m> is a lower bound of <m>B_0</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was an arbitrary upper bound,
            this shows that in fact <m>c</m> is the lest upper bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            Hence <m>A</m> also has the lest upper bound property since the nonempty subset <m>A_0</m> was arbitrary.

          (a) We show this for both sets simultaneously as their proofs are nearly identical.
          We note the minor differences in parentheses.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>A = [0,1]</m>
            (or <m>A = \clop{0,1}</m>)
            and consider any nonempty subset <m>A_0</m> of <m>A</m> that is bounded above in <m>A</m>.
            So suppose that <m>b</m> is an upper bound of <m>A_0</m> in <m>A</m> so that <m>0 \leq b \leq 1</m>
            (or <m>0 \leq b \lt 1</m>).
            Now, of course <m>A_0</m> has a least upper bound <m>c</m> in <m>\reals</m> since it is also a nonempty subset of <m>\reals</m> that is bounded above.
            Obviously <m>c \leq b</m> since it is the
            <em>least</em> upper bound.
            For any <m>x \in A_0</m> we of course have that <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m>
            (or <m>0 \leq x \lt 1</m>),
            and clearly <m>x \leq c</m> since it is an upper bound of <m>A_0</m>.
            Thus we have <m>0 \leq x \leq c \leq b \leq 1</m>
            (or <m>0 \leq x \leq c \leq b \lt 1</m>)
            so that <m>c \in A</m>.
            Hence <m>A_0</m> has a least upper bound in <m>A</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) First we claim that both <m>[0,1] \times [0,1]</m> and
          <m>\clop{0,1} \times [0,1]</m> have the least upper bound property.
          We show this for both sets simultaneously as their proofs are identical.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>X = [0,1] \times [0,1]</m>
            (or <m>X = \clop{0,1} \times [0,1]</m>).
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>X</m> that is bounded above,
            and that <m>\pptt{1}</m> is an upper bound of <m>A</m> in <m>X</m>.
            Then of course we have <m>x_1 \in [0,1]</m>
            (or <m>x_1 \in \clop{0,1}</m>).
            Define <m>A_x = \braces{x \where \pptt{} \in A}</m> so that clearly <m>A_x \ss [0,1]</m>
            (or <m>A_x \ss \clop{0,1}</m>).
            It then follows that <m>x \leq x_1</m> for any <m>x \in A_x</m> since
            <m>\pptt{1}</m> is an upper bound of <m>A</m> in the dictionary order.
            Also clearly <m>A_x</m> is nonempty since <m>A</m> is.
            Thus <m>A_x</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>[0,1]</m>
            (or <m>\clop{0,1}</m>)
            that is bounded above
            (by <m>x_1</m>)
            so that it has a least upper bound <m>a</m> by what was shown in part<nbsp/>(a).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, if <m>a \notin A_x</m> then set <m>b = 0</m>.
            Otherwise define <m>A_y = \braces{y \where a \times y \in A}</m>.
            Then, since <m>a \in A_x</m>,
            there is a <m>y \in [0,1]</m> where <m>a \times y \in A</m>,
            which shows that <m>y \in A_y</m> and hence <m>A_y \neq \es</m>.
            We also clearly have that <m>A_y \ss [0,1]</m> so that <m>A_y</m> is bounded above by <m>1</m>.
            Then <m>A_y</m> has a least upper bound <m>b</m>,
            again by what was shown in part<nbsp/>(a).
            In either case we assert that
            <m>a \times b</m> is the least upper bound of <m>A</m> in <m>X</m> in the dictionary order.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it is obvious that <m>a \times b \in X</m> based on how <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> were defined.
            Consider any <m>\pptt{} \in A</m> so that <m>x \in A_x</m>,
            and hence <m>x \leq a</m> since <m>a</m> is the least upper bound of <m>A_x</m>.
            If <m>x \lt a</m> then of course <m>\pptt{} \leq a \times b</m>,
            so assume that <m>x = a</m>.
            Then <m>a = x \in A_x</m> so that <m>b</m> was defined as the least upper bound of <m>A_y</m>.
            Then we have that <m>y \in A_y</m> since <m>\pptt{} = a \times y \in A</m>,
            and thus <m>y \leq b</m> since <m>b</m> is the least upper bound of <m>A_y</m>.
            This shows that <m>\pptt{} \leq a \times b</m> so that we have shown that
            <m>a \times b</m> is an upper bound of <m>A</m> since <m>\pptt{}</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is the <em>least</em>
            upper bound consider any <m>\pptt{0} \in X</m> where <m>\pptt{0} \lt a \times b</m>.
            If <m>x_0 \lt a</m> then there must be an <m>x \in A_x</m> where
            <m>x_0 \lt x</m> since <m>x_0</m> cannot be an upper bound of <m>A_x</m> since
            <m>x_0 \lt a</m> and <m>a</m> is the least upper bound of <m>A_x</m>.
            Then, since <m>x \in A_x</m>,
            there is a <m>y \in [0,1]</m> where <m>\pptt{} \in A</m>.
            Hence <m>\pptt{0} \lt \pptt{}</m> since <m>x_0 \lt x</m> so that
            <m>\pptt{0}</m> is not an upper bound of <m>A</m>.
            On the other hand if <m>x_0 = a</m> we must have
            <m>y_0 \lt b</m> so that it cannot be that <m>b = 0</m>,
            and hence it must be that <m>a \in A_x</m>.
            Then there must be a <m>y \in A_y</m> where
            <m>y_0 \lt y</m> since <m>y_0</m> cannot be an upper bound of <m>A_y</m> since
            <m>y_0 \lt b</m> and <m>b</m> is the least upper bound of <m>A_y</m>.
            Hence <m>a \times y \in A</m>, <m>x_0 = a</m>,
            and <m>y_0 \lt y</m> so that <m>\pptt{0} \lt a \times y \in A</m>,
            which shows that <m>\pptt{0}</m> is not an upper bound of <m>A</m>.
            Thus in either case <m>\pptt{0}</m> is not an upper bound of <m>A</m>,
            which shows that <m>a \times b</m> is the least upper bound since <m>\pptt{0} \lt a \times b</m> was arbitrary.

            This of course completes the proof that <m>A</m> has a least upper bound,
            which shows that <m>X</m> has the least upper bound property since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary nonempty subset.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          We also claim that <m>[0,1] \times \clop{0,1}</m> does <em>not</em>
          have the least upper bound property.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>X = [0,1] \times \clop{0,1}</m>.
            Consider the set <m>A = \braces{0} \times \clop{0,1}</m>,
            which is clearly a nonempty subset of <m>X</m>.
            This subset also obviously has an upper bound in <m>X</m> in the dictionary order,
            for example the point <m>1 \times 0</m>.\ So let
            <m>\pptt{1}</m> be any upper bound of <m>A</m> in <m>X</m> and suppose for the moment that <m>x_1 = 0</m>.
            Then <m>y_1 \in \clop{0,1}</m> so that <m>0 \leq y_1 \lt 1</m>,
            but then there is a <m>y_0 \in \reals</m> such that <m>0 \leq y_1 \lt y_0 \lt 1</m>.
            Then <m>y_0 \in \clop{0,1}</m> so that <m>x_1 \times y_0 = 0 \times y_0 \in A</m>,
            but also <m>\pptt{1} \lt x_1 \times y_0</m> so that
            <m>\pptt{1}</m> cannot be an upper bound of <m>A</m>.
            So it must be that in fact
            <m>x_1 \neq 0</m> and hence <m>x_1 > 0</m>.
            Now let <m>x_0 = x_1/2 > 0</m> and <m>y_0 = 0</m> so that clearly <m>\pptt{} \lt \pptt{0} \lt \pptt{1}</m> for any
            <m>\pptt{} \in A</m> since <m>x = 0 \lt x_1/2 = x_0 \lt x_1</m>.
            This shows that <m>\pptt{0}</m> is still an upper bound of <m>A</m> but that <m>\pptt{0} \lt \pptt{1}</m>.
            Since <m>\pptt{1}</m> was an arbitrary upper bound of <m>A</m>,
            this proves that <m>A</m> can have no
            <em>least</em> upper bound!

            First, we have by (4) that <m>1 \cdot (1/1) = 1</m>,
            where <m>1/1</m> is the reciprocal of <m>1</m>.
            We also have that <m>1 \cdot (1/1) = (1/1) \cdot 1 = 1/1</m> by (2) and (3).
            Therefore <m>1/1 = 1 \cdot (1/1) = 1</m> so that <m>1</m> is its own reciprocal.
            Then, by the definition of division,
            we have <m>x/1 = x \cdot (1/1) = x \cdot 1 = x</m> by (3).

            Suppose that <m>x \neq 0</m> and <m>y \neq 0</m>.
            Also suppose to the contrary that <m>xy = 0</m>.
            Since <m>y \neq 0</m> it follows from (4) that <m>1/y</m> exists.
            So, we have <m>(xy) \cdot (1/y) = 0 \cdot (1/y) = 0</m> by part<nbsp/>(b).

            which is a contradiction since we supposed that <m>x \neq 0</m>.

            Hence we have <m>0 = x \cdot (1/x) = 1</m>,
            which is a contradiction since we know that <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> are distinct by (3).
            So, if we accept that <m>x \neq 0</m>,

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>x \neq 0</m> we either have that <m>x> 0</m> or <m>x \lt 0</m> since the <m>\lt</m> relation is an order
            (in particular a linear order since this is part of the definition of order in this text).
            If <m>x > 0</m> then we have <m>x^2 = x \cdot x > 0 \cdot x = 0</m> by (6)
            (since <m>x > 0</m>)
            and Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b).
            If <m>x \lt 0</m> then we have <m>0 = 0 \cdot x \lt x \cdot x = x^2</m> by part<nbsp/>(e)

            By (4) we know that <m>1 \neq 0</m> so that <m>1^2 > 0</m> by part<nbsp/>(f).

            Hence <m>1 = 1^2 > 0</m>.
            It then follows from part<nbsp/>(c) that
            <m>-1 \lt 0</m> so that we have <m>-1 \lt 0 \lt 1</m> as desired.

          (h) The set $H$ of all functions $f: {\ints_+} \to {\ints_+}$ that are eventually constant.

          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that <m>xy > 0</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>x = 0</m>,
            for then we would have <m>0 = 0 \cdot y = xy > 0</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b),
            which is impossible by the definition of an order.
            Hence we have <m>x \neq 0</m>,
            and an analogous argument shows that <m>y \neq 0</m> as well.
            We then have the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x > 0</m>.
            Suppose that <m>y \lt 0</m>.
            Then, by part<nbsp/>(e) and Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b),
            we have <m>xy \lt 0 \cdot y = 0</m> since <m>x > 0</m> and <m>y \lt 0</m>,
            which contradicts our initial supposition.
            Thus, since we know that <m>y \neq 0</m>,
            it has to be that <m>y > 0</m> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \lt 0</m>.
            Suppose that <m>y > 0</m>.
            Then, by (6) and Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b),
            we have <m>0 = 0 \cdot y > xy</m> since <m>0 > x</m> and <m>y > 0</m>,
            which again contradicts the initial supposition.
            So it must be that <m>y \lt 0</m> also since <m>y \neq 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore in every case either both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are positive or they are both negative.
            Since <m>x \neq 0</m>,
            these cases are exhaustive so that this shows the result.

            <m>xy > 0 \cdot y = 0</m> by (6) and Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b).
            In the other case in which <m>x\lt 0</m> and <m>y\lt 0</m> we have
            <m>0 = 0 \cdot y \lt xy</m> by part<nbsp/>(e) and Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b) since <m>0 > x</m> and <m>y \lt 0</m>.

            First, it cannot be that <m>1/x=0</m> because then we would have <m>1 = x(1/x) = x \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot x = 0</m> by (4), (2),
            and Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b).
            This is clearly a contradiction since we know that <m>1 \neq 0</m> by (3).
            Hence <m>1/x \neq 0</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>1/x\lt 0</m> so that
            <m>1 = x(1/x) \lt 0 \cdot (1/x) = 0</m> by part<nbsp/>(e) since <m>x>0</m> and <m>1/x\lt 0</m>,
            and we have also used Exercise<nbsp/>4.1 part<nbsp/>(b).
            This is also a contradiction since it was proved in part<nbsp/>(g) that <m>1>0</m>.
            Hence the only remaining possibility is that <m>1/x>0</m> as desired.

            First, since the order is transitive, we have <m>x,y > 0</m>.

          (a) We must show that <m>\intA</m> is inductive.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, consider any <m>A \in \inds</m>.
            Then, since <m>A</m> is inductive, <m>1 \in A</m>.
            Since <m>A</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>1 \in \intA</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in \intA</m> and again consider arbitrary <m>A \in \inds</m>.
            Then <m>x \in A</m> so that
            <m>x+1 \in A</m> also since <m>A</m> is inductive.
            Since <m>A</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>x+1 \in \intA</m>.
            Hence by definition <m>\intA</m> is inductive.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\inds</m> be the collection of all inductive sets of <m>\reals</m> so that by definition <m>\pints = \intA</m>.
            It then follows immediately from part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>\pints</m> is inductive since <m>\inds</m> is a collection of inductive sets.
            This shows property (1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>A</m> is an inductive set of positive integers.
            That is, <m>A</m> is inductive and <m>A \ss \pints</m>.
            Consider any <m>x \in \pints = \intB</m>,
            where again <m>\inds</m> is the the collection of all inductive subsets of <m>\reals</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>A \ss \pints \ss \reals</m> so that
            <m>A \in \inds</m> since <m>A</m> is an inductive subset of <m>\reals</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in A</m>
            (since <m>x \in \intB</m> and <m>A \in \inds</m>)
            so that <m>\pints \ss A</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>A = \pints</m> as desired since also <m>A \ss \pints</m>.
            This shows property (2).

          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>A</m> be the set of integers such that the hypothesis is true.
            Clearly the result is then shown if we can prove that <m>A = \pints</m>.
            So first, clearly <m>1 \in A</m> since the set
            <m>\braces{1}</m> has only a single nonempty subset, i.e.
            <m>\braces{1}</m> itself, in which 1 is clearly the largest element.
            Now suppose that <m>n \in A</m> so that every nonempty subset of
            <m>S_{n+1} = \intsfin{n}</m> has a largest element.
            Consider any nonempty subset <m>B</m> of <m>S_{n+2} = \intsfin{n+1}</m>,
            noting that <m>S_{n+2} = S_{n+1} \cup \braces{n+1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>n+1 \in B</m>.
            Then, for any other <m>k \in B</m>,
            <m>k \in S_{n+2}</m> so that either <m>k = n+1</m> or <m>k \in S_{n+1}</m> so that
            <m>k \lt n+1</m> by the definition of <m>S_{n+1}</m>.
            Thus in either case <m>k \leq n+1</m> so that <m>n+1</m> is the largest element of <m>B</m> since <m>k</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>n+1 \notin B</m>.
            Then clearly <m>B \ss S_{n+1}</m> so that <m>B</m> has a largest element by the induction hypothesis since <m>B</m> is nonempty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in either case <m>B</m> has a largest element so that
            <m>n+1 \in A</m> since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary nonempty subset of <m>S_{n+2} = \intsfin{n+1}</m>.
            This shows that <m>A</m> is an inductive set of positive integers so that
            <m>A = \pints</m> as desired by the Principle of Induction.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) There could be nonempty subsets of <m>\pints</m> that are <em>not</em>
          subsets of <m>S_{n+1} = \intsfin{n}</m> for any <m>n \in \pints</m>,
          in which cases the hypothesis of part<nbsp/>(a) is not satisfied so that the conclusion does not necessarily apply.
          In fact, <m>\pints</m> itself is an example of such a set where both the hypothesis and the conclusion are false.

          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>a \in \pints</m> and define <m>X_a = \braces{x \in \reals \where a+x \in \pints}</m>.
            We show that <m>X_a</m> is inductive.
            First, since <m>a \in \pints</m> we have that
            <m>a+1 \in \pints</m> since <m>\pints</m> is inductive.
            Hence <m>1 \in X_a</m> by definition.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in X_a</m> so that <m>a+x \in \pints</m>.
            Then we have <m>a+(x+1) = (a+x)+1 \in \pints</m> since
            <m>a+x \in \pints</m> and <m>\pints</m> is inductive.
            This shows by definition that
            <m>x+1 \in X_a</m> and therefore that <m>X_a</m> is inductive.
            It follows that <m>\pints \ss X_a</m> since <m>\pints</m> is defined as the intersection of all inductive subsets of reals,
            of which <m>X_a</m> is one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, for any <m>a,b \in \pints</m>,
            we have that <m>b \in X_a</m> since <m>\pints \ss X_a</m>.
            Thus by definition <m>a + b \in \pints</m> as desired
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)

        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>a \in \pints</m> and define <m>X_a = \braces{x \in \reals \where a \cdot x \in \pints}</m>.
            We show that <m>X_a</m> is inductive.
            To this end, we first have that
            <m>a \cdot 1 = a \in \pints</m> so that <m>1 \in X_a</m> by definition.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in X_a</m> so that <m>ax \in \pints</m>.
            Then we have <m>a \cdot (x+1) = a \cdot x + a \cdot 1 = ax + a \in \pints</m> by part<nbsp/>(a) since we know both <m>ax</m> and <m>a</m> are in <m>\pints</m>.
            Hence <m>x+1 \in X_a</m> by definition.
            This shows that <m>X_a</m> is inductive so that again <m>\pints \ss X_a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence for any <m>a,b \in \pints</m> we have that
            <m>b \in X_a</m> since <m>\pints \ss X_a</m>.
            It then follows by definition that <m>a \cdot b \in \pints</m> as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>X = \braces{x \in \reals \where x-1 \in \pintsz}</m>,
            which we show is inductive.
            First, we have <m>1 - 1 = 1 + (-1) = 0</m> so that clearly
            <m>1 \in \pintsz</m> and hence <m>1 \in X</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in X</m> so that <m>x-1 \in \pintsz</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x-1 \in \braces{0}</m>.
            Then it must be that <m>x - 1 = 0</m>,
            which clearly implies <m>x = 1 \in \pints</m> since <m>\pints</m> is inductive.
            Then <m>(x+1) - 1 = x + (1 - 1) = x + 0 = x \in \pints</m> so that
            <m>(x+1)-1 \in \pintsz</m> and therefore <m>x+1 \in X</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x-1 \in \pints</m>.
            Then <m>(x+1) - 1 = x + (1 -1) = x + ((-1) + 1) = (x - 1) + 1 \in \pints</m> since
            <m>x-1 \in \pints</m> and <m>\pints</m> is inductive.
            Thus clearly <m>(x+1)-1 \in \pintsz</m> so that <m>x+1 \in X</m> by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in both cases <m>x+1 \in X</m>,
            which shows that <m>X</m> is inductive,
            and so <m>\pints \ss X</m>.
            Therefore, for any <m>a \in \pints</m>,
            we have that also <m>x \in X</m> since <m>\pints \ss X</m>.
            Then, by the definition of <m>X</m>,
            it follows that <m>a-1 \in \pintsz</m> as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that the set
            <m>X_c = \braces{x \in \reals \where c+x \in \ints \text{ and } c-x \in \ints}</m> is inductive for any <m>c \in \ints</m>.
            So consider any <m>c</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>\ints</m> so that <m>c,b \in \pintsz \cup \nints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b \in \pints</m>.
            Then <m>b+1 \in \pints</m> since <m>\pints</m> is inductive and <m>b-1 \in \pintsz</m> by part<nbsp/>(c).
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b = 0</m>.
            Then <m>b + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \in \pints</m> since it is inductive,
            and <m>b - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1 \in \nints</m> since <m>1 \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b \in \nints</m>.
            Then <m>b = -a</m> for <m>a \in \pints</m>,
            and we then have that <m>a+1 \in \pints</m> since <m>\pints</m> is inductive.
            Hence <m>b - 1 = -a - 1 = -(a+1) \in \nints</m>.
            We also have that <m>a-1 \in \pintsz</m> by part<nbsp/>(c),
            from which it is trivial to show that <m>-(a-1) \in \nints \cup \braces{0}</m>.
            Therefore <m>b + 1 = -a + 1 = -(a - 1) \in \nints \cup \braces{0}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in all cases we have that <m>b+1</m> and <m>b-1</m> are in <m>\pints</m> or
            <m>\braces{0}</m> or <m>\nints</m> so that they are both in <m>\ints</m>,
            and so <m>1 \in X_b</m>.
            Note that this is the case for any
            <m>b \in \ints</m> so that it is clearly true for <m>c</m>, i.e.
            <m>1 \in X_c</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in X_c</m> so that <m>c+x</m> and <m>c-x</m> are both in <m>\ints</m>.
            It then follows that <m>1 \in X_{c+x}</m> and <m>1 \in X_{c-x}</m> so that
            <m>c + (x+1) = (c+x) + 1 \in \ints</m> and <m>c - (x + 1) = (c -x) - 1 \in \ints</m>.
            This then shows that <m>x+1 \in X_c</m>.
            Hence <m>X_c</m> is inductive for any
            <m>c \in \ints</m> so that <m>\pints \ss X_c</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider <m>c,d \in \ints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>d \in \pints</m>.
            Then clearly <m>d \in X_c</m> since <m>\pints \ss X_c</m>.
            Hence by definition <m>c+d</m> and <m>c-d</m> are both in <m>\ints</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>d \in \nints</m>.
            Then by definition <m>d = -a</m> for <m>a \in \pints</m> so that
            <m>a \in X_c</m> since <m>\pints \ss X_c</m>.
            Then <m>c + a</m> and <m>c - a</m> are both in <m>\ints</m> by the definition of <m>X_c</m>.
            Hence <m>c + d = c + (-a) = c - a \in \ints</m> and <m>c - d = c - (-a) = c + a \in \ints</m>.

            Therefore we have shown that <m>c+d</m> and <m>c-d</m> are both integers in all cases,

            We first show that <m>X_c</m> is inductive for any such <m>c \in \ints</m>.
            We have <m>c \cdot 1 = c \in \ints</m> so that <m>1 \in X_c</m>.

          The following lemma is the familiar proof by induction,

          Henceforth we use this whenever induction is required.

        <lemma>
          <statement>
            <p>
              (Proof by Induction) Suppose that <m>P(x)</m> is a statement with parameter <m>x</m>.
              Suppose also that <m>P(1)</m> is true and that <m>P(x)</m> implies <m>P(x+1)</m>.
              Then <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Define the set <m>X = \braces{x \in \reals \where P(x)}</m>.
            We show that <m>X</m> is inductive.
            Clearly since <m>P(1)</m> is true we have <m>1 \in X</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in X</m> so that <m>P(x)</m> is true.
            Then <m>P(x+1)</m> is also true so that <m>x+1 \in X</m>.
            This shows that <m>X</m> is inductive so that <m>\pints \ss X</m>.
            So, for any positive integer <m>n</m> we have that <m>n \in X</m> since <m>\pints \ss X</m>.
            Therefore <m>P(n)</m> is true.
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows the desired result.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Fix <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            We show the result by induction on <m>m</m>.
            First, we clearly have <m>a^n a^1 = a^n \cdot a = a^{n+1}</m> by the inductive definition.
            Now suppose that <m>a^n a^m = a^{n+m}</m>.

            which completes the induction step.

        <proof>
          <p>
            We again fix <m>n \in \pints</m> and use induction on <m>m</m>.
            First, we have <m>\parens{a^n}^1 = a^n = a^{n \cdot 1}</m> by the inductive definition.
            Supposing now that <m>\parens{a^n}^m = a^{n \cdot m}</m>, we have

            First, we have <m>a^1 b^1 = ab = (ab)^1</m> by the inductive definition.
            Now suppose that <m>a^m b^m = (ab)^m</m> so that

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is an arbitrary nonempty set of real number that is bounded below by <m>a</m>.
            Now let <m>B = \braces{-x \where x \in A}</m> and <m>b = -a</m>.
            First, we claim that <m>b</m> is an upper bound of <m>B</m>.
            So consider any <m>y \in B</m> so that <m>y = -x</m> for some <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then <m>a \leq x</m> since <m>a</m> a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(d) that <m>y = -x \leq -a = b</m>.
            Since <m>y \in B</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>b</m> is an upper bound of <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>B</m> is clearly nonempty
            (since <m>A</m> is),
            we have that <m>B</m> has a least upper bound
            <m>d = \sup B</m> since the reals have the least upper bound property.
            We claim that <m>c = -d</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            So first consider any <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>y = -x \in B</m>.
            Then we have <m>y \leq d</m> since <m>d = \sup B</m>.
            Hence <m>c = -d \leq -y = x</m> again by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(d).
            Since <m>x \in A</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>c</m> is in fact a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>x</m> is any lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            Then, by the same argument as above for <m>b = -a</m>,
            we have that <m>y = -x</m> is an upper bound of <m>B</m>.
            It then follows that <m>d \leq y</m> since <m>d</m> is the
            <em>least</em> upper bound of <m>B</m>.
            Then, again by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(d),
            we have <m>x = -(-x) = -y \leq -d = c</m>,
            which shows that <m>c</m> is in fact the greatest lower bound since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
            This completes the proof.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, let <m>A = \braces{1/n \where n \in \pints}</m> so that we must show that <m>\inf{A} = 0</m>.
            For any <m>x \in A</m> we have that <m>x = 1/n</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Then <m>n > 0</m> so that <m>x = 1/n > 0</m> also by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(i).
            Hence <m>0 \leq x</m> is true,
            which shows that <m>0</m> is a lower bound of <m>A</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x > 0</m> so that also <m>1/x > 0</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(i).
            Then, by the Archimedean ordering property there is an
            <m>n \in \pints</m> such that <m>n > 1/x > 0</m>
            (since otherwise <m>1/x</m> would be an upper bound of <m>\pints</m>).
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(j) that <m>1/n \lt 1/(1/x) = x</m>.
            Since clearly <m>1/n \in A</m> we have that <m>x</m> is <em>not</em>
            a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            Since <m>x>0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>0</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>A</m> since,
            by the contrapositive,
            <m>x</m> being a lower bound of <m>A</m> implies that <m>x \leq 0</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any real <m>a</m> where <m>0 \lt  a \lt  1</m>.
            First we show that the set <m>\braces{1/a^n \where n \in \pints}</m> has no upper bound.
            To this end define <m>h = (1-a)/a = 1/a - 1</m> so that <m>1+h = 1 + (1/a - 1) = 1/a</m>.
            Clearly we have
            <md>
              <mrow>a \amp \lt  1</mrow>
              <mrow>-a \amp > -1</mrow>
              <mrow>1-a \amp > 1 -1  = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{1-a}{a} \amp > \frac{0}{a} = 0 \amp  \text{ (since \(a>0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>h \amp > 0</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>1+h > 1 > 0</m> and
            <md>
              <mrow>h \amp > 0</mrow>
              <mrow>h^2 \amp > h \cdot 0 = 0 \amp  \text{ (since \(h>0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>n h^2 \amp > n \cdot 0 = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>n \in \pints</m> since <m>n > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show by induction that <m>(1+h)^n \geq 1 + nh</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            For <m>n = 1</m> we clearly have <m>(1+h)^n = (1+h)^1 = 1+h \geq 1+h = 1+1\cdot h = 1+nh</m>.
            Now, supposing that <m>(1+h)^n \geq 1 + nh</m>,we have
            <md>
              <mrow>(1+h)^{n+1} \amp = (1+h)^n (1+h)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \geq (1+nh)(1+h) \amp  \text{ (since \(1+h > 0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 1 + nh + h + nh^2</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \geq 1 + nh + h \amp  \text{ (since \(nh^2 > 0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 1 + (n+1)h \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which completes the induction.
            So consider any real <m>x</m>.
            Then, since we know that <m>\pints</m> has no upper bound,
            there is an <m>n \in \pints</m> where <m>n > x/h</m>
            (noting that <m>h > 0</m>)
            so that
            <md>
              <mrow>n \amp > x/h</mrow>
              <mrow>nh \amp > (x/h)h = x \amp  \text{ (since \(h > 0\)) }</mrow>
              <mrow>1 + nh \amp > 1 + x > x \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we have <m>1/a^n = (1/a)^n = (1+h)^n \geq 1 + nh > x</m>,
            which shows that the set <m>\braces{1/a^n \where n \in \pints}</m> is unbounded above since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show the main result.
            Let <m>A = \braces{a^n \where n \in \pints}</m> so that we must show that <m>\inf{A} = 0</m>.
            First we show by induction that 0 is a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
            For <m>n=1</m> we clearly have <m>a^n = a^1 = a \geq 0</m>.
            Then, if <m>a^n \geq 0</m>,
            we have <m>a^{n+1} = a^n \cdot a \geq 0 \cdot a = 0</m> since <m>a > 0</m>.
            This completes the induction so that clearly <m>0</m> is indeed a lower bound of <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any real <m>x > 0</m> so that <m>1/x > 0</m> also.
            Then, by what was shown above,
            we know that there is an <m>n \in \pints</m> such that <m>1/a^n > 1/x > 0</m>.
            We then have <m>a^n = 1/(1/a^n) \lt 1/(1/x) = x</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(j).
            This shows that <m>x</m> is <em>not</em>
            a lower bound of <m>A</m> since obviously <m>a^n \in A</m>.
            It then follows that <m>0</m> is the <em>greatest</em>
            lower bound of <m>A</m> since <m>x>0</m> was arbitrary,
            because, by the contrapositive,
            <m>x</m> being a lower bound of <m>A</m> implies that <m>x \leq 0</m>.
            Hence <m>0 = \inf{A}</m> as desired.

            First we show that <m>\ints</m> is inductive.
            Clearly <m>1 \in \ints</m> since <m>1 \in \pints \ss \ints</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>n \in \ints</m> so that clearly
            <m>n+1 \in \ints</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.5 part<nbsp/>(d) since <m>1 \in \ints</m>.

          <p>
            Next, consider any <m>x \in \reals</m>.

            Suppose to the contrary that

            Let <m>S = \braces{k \in \ints \where 0 \lt k \lt 1}</m> so that clearly <m>n \in S</m> so that <m>S \neq \es</m>.
            Also since <m>0 \lt k</m> and
            <m>k \in \ints</m> for any <m>k \in S</m>,
            clearly <m>S \ss \pints</m>.
            Thus <m>S</m> is a nonempty subset of positive integers so that it has a smallest element <m>m</m> by the well-ordering property.
            Since <m>m \in S</m> we have <m>0 \lt m \lt 1</m> and hence
            <m>m^2 = m \cdot m \lt 1 \cdot m = m \lt 1</m> by property (6) since <m>m > 0</m>.
            By the same property clearly
            <m>0 = 0 \cdot m \lt m \cdot m = m^2</m> as well so that <m>0 \lt m^2 \lt 1</m>.
            Also, clearly <m>m^2 = m \cdot m \in \ints</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.5 part<nbsp/>(e) since

        <proof>

            Suppose that <m>A</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\ints</m> and that it is bounded above by <m>\a \in \reals</m>.
            Since <m>A \neq \es</m>, there is an <m>a \in A</m>,
            so define <m>A' = \braces{n - a + 1 \where n \in A}</m>.
            First we claim that <m>\a' = \a - a + 1</m> is an upper bound of <m>A'</m> So consider any <m>n' \in A'</m> so that
            <m>n' = n-a+1</m> for some <m>n \in A</m>.
            Since <m>\a</m> is an upper bound of <m>A</m> we have

              <mrow>n \amp \leq \a</mrow>

            </md>,
            which shows that <m>\a'</m> is an upper bound of <m>A'</m> since <m>n'</m> was an arbitrary element.
            We also have that there is an <m>N' \in \pints</m> such that

            we have that <m>n' \in A'</m> so that <m>n' \leq \a' \lt N'</m>.
            Since also clearly <m>n' \in \pints</m>,
            we have that <m>n' \in S_{N'} = \braces{k \in \pints \where k \lt N'} = \intsfin{N'-1}</m>.
            Hence <m>B' \ss S_{N'}</m> since <m>n'</m> was arbitrary.

            Hence <m>1 \in B'</m> since clearly also
            <m>1 \in \pints</m> since it is inductive.
            Thus <m>B'</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>S_{N'}</m> so that it has a largest element <m>b'</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.4 part<nbsp/>(a).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>b' \in B'</m>, we have that
            <m>b' \in A'</m> so that there is a <m>b \in A</m> such that <m>b' = b-a+1</m>.
            We claim that <m>b</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            We already know that <m>b \in A</m> so we need only show that it is also an upper bound of <m>A</m>.
            So consider any <m>n \in A</m> so that clearly <m>n' = n - a + 1 \in A'</m>.
            Now, it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.5 part<nbsp/>(d) that
            <m>n' \in \ints</m> since <m>n,a,1 \in \ints</m>.
            Thus we have the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>n' \in \pints</m>.
            Then, clearly <m>n' \in A' \cap \pints = B'</m> so that
            <m>n' \leq b'</m> since <m>b'</m> is the largest element of <m>B'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>n' \in \nints \cup \braces{0}</m>.
            Then <m>n' \lt 1 \leq b'</m> since
            <m>1 \in B'</m> and <m>b'</m> is the largest element of <m>B'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in either case <m>n' \leq b'</m> is true so that
            <md>
              <mrow>n' \amp \leq b'</mrow>
              <mrow>n - a + 1 \amp \leq b - a + 1</mrow>

              <mrow>n \amp \leq b \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>b</m> is an upper bound and thus the largest element of <m>A</m> since <m>n</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose an <m>x \in \reals</m> where
            <m>x \notin \ints</m> and let <m>A = \braces{n \in \ints \where n \lt x}</m>.
            It follows from <xref ref="lem_intreal_intlub">Lemma</xref>
            that there is an <m>m \in \ints</m> where <m>m \lt x</m> since <m>\ints</m> has no lower bounds.
            Hence by definition <m>m \in A</m> so that <m>A \neq \es</m>.
            Clearly also <m>x</m> is an upper bound of <m>A</m> so that <m>A</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\ints</m> that is bounded above.
            It then follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>A</m> has a largest element <m>n</m>,
            where clearly <m>n \lt x</m> since <m>n \in A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, suppose for the moment that <m>n+1 \leq x</m>.
            Then, since <m>\ints</m> is inductive
            (again by <xref ref="lem_intreal_intlub">Lemma</xref>)
            and <m>n \in \ints</m>, we have that <m>n+1 \in \ints</m> as well.
            But <m>x \notin \ints</m> so that it must be that <m>n+1 \neq x</m>,
            and hence <m>n+1 \lt x</m>.
            Then <m>n+1 \in A</m> so that
            <m>n+1 \leq n</m> since <m>n</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            However, this contradicts the obvious fact that <m>n+1 > n</m> so that it must be that <m>n+1 \leq x</m> is not true.
            Hence <m>n+1 > x</m> and thus we have shown that <m>n \lt x \lt n+1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, suppose that there is an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>m \lt x \lt m+1</m>.
            Then <m>m \in A</m> so that
            <m>m \leq n</m> since <m>n</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            Suppose for a moment that <m>m \lt n</m>.
            Then we would have <m>m \lt n \lt x \lt m+1</m> so that <m>n</m> is an integer between <m>m</m> and <m>m+1</m>,
            which violates <xref ref="cor_intreal_intbet">Corollary</xref>.
            Thus is has to be that <m>m = n</m>
            (since <m>m \leq n</m>),
            which shows that <m>n</m> is the unique integer such that <m>n \lt x \lt n+1</m>.

            Suppose that <m>x,y \in \reals</m> and <m>x-y > 1</m>.
            If <m>x \in \ints</m> then let <m>n = x-1</m> so that clearly
            <m>n \in \ints</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.5 part<nbsp/>(d).
            First, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x - y \amp > 1</mrow>
              <mrow>x \amp > 1 + y</mrow>

              <mrow>n \amp > y \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also clearly have <m>n = x - 1 \lt x</m> so that <m>y \lt n \lt x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if <m>x \notin \ints</m>,
            then we know from part<nbsp/>(b) that there is a unique integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n \lt  x \lt  n+1</m>.
            We also have that
            <md>
              <mrow>x \amp \lt  n + 1</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \lt  x - y \amp \lt  n + 1 - y</mrow>

              <mrow>y \amp \lt  n</mrow>
            </md>
            so that again <m>y \lt  n \lt  x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in both cases we have found an integer <m>n</m> such that
            <m>y \lt n \lt x</m>, which proves the result.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x,y \in \reals</m> where <m>y \lt  x</m>.
            Then <m>0 \lt  x-y</m> so that <m>1/(x-y)</m> exists.. Since <m>\pints</m> is unbounded above there is a
            <m>b \in \pints</m> where <m>b > 1/(x-y)</m>.
            Hence
            <md>
              <mrow>b \amp > \frac{1}{x-y}</mrow>
              <mrow>b(x-y) \amp > 1 \amp  \text{ (since \(x-y > 0\)) }</mrow>

            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows from part<nbsp/>(c) that there is an integer <m>a</m> such that <m>by \lt a \lt bx</m>.
            We then have that <m>y \lt a/b \lt x</m> since <m>b > 0</m>
            (since <m>b \in \pints</m>).
            This shows the result since clearly <m>a/b</m> is rational because <m>a,b \in \ints</m>.

          (b) We modify this result so that the <m>h</m> in the second part is not just positive but also <m>h \lt x</m>.
          In fact, without this stipulation,
          the theorem becomes obvious since any arbitrarily large <m>h</m> will suffice.
          Because then then <m>x-h</m> is arbitrarily large in magnitude
          (but negative)
          so that <m>(x-h)^2</m> can be made arbitrarily large so that of course <m>(x-h)^2 > a</m>.
          Adding the stipulation that
          <m>0 \lt h \lt x</m> makes the theorem more useful and is necessary for it to be of use in part<nbsp/>(c) below.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>x>0</m>.
            Then clearly <m>2x > 2\cdot 0 = 0</m> as well.
            Also it then follows that <m>2x + 1 > 1 > 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>x^2 \lt  a</m> then clearly <m>0 \lt  a - x^2</m>.
            Hence we have that <m>0 \lt  (a-x^2) / (2x+1)</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 parts (i) and (h) since both <m>a-x^2</m> and <m>2x+1</m> are positive.
            So let <m>y = \min(1, (a-x^2)/(2x+1))</m> so that clearly both
            <m>y \leq 1</m> and <m>y \leq (a-x^2)/(2x+1)</m>.
            Since <m>0 \lt  1</m> and <m>0 \lt  (a-x^2)/(2x+1)</m>,
            we have that <m>0 \lt  y</m> so that it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.9 part<nbsp/>(d) that there is a rational <m>h</m> such that <m>0 \lt  h \lt  y</m>.
            Hence <m>0 \lt  h \lt  y \leq 1</m> so that,
            by part<nbsp/>(a), we have

            If <m>x^2 > a</m> then clearly <m>x^2 - a > 0</m>.
            Then we have again that <m>(x^2-a)/(2x)</m> is positive since we showed previously that <m>2x</m> is.
            So let <m>y = \min(1, (x^2-a)/(2x),
            x)</m> so that clearly <m>y \leq 1</m>,
            <m>y \leq (x^2 - a)/(2x)</m>, and <m>y \leq x</m>.
            Since both 1, <m>(x^2 - a)/(2x)</m>,
            and <m>x</m> are all positive it follows that
            <m>0 \lt  y</m> so that there is a rational <m>h</m> such that
            <m>0 \lt  h \lt  y</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.9 part<nbsp/>(d).
            Therefore <m>0 > -h > -y</m>.

            Suppose that <m>a > 0</m> and let <m>B = \braces{x \in \reals \where x^2 \lt a}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>a \lt 1</m> then <m>0 \lt a \lt 1</m> so that
            <m>a^2 = a \cdot a \lt 1 \cdot a = a</m> so that <m>a</m> itself is in <m>B</m>
            (and of course <m>a</m> is positive).
            Now consider any <m>x \in B</m> so that <m>x^2 \lt a</m>.
            Then <m>x^2 \lt a \lt 1</m> so that also <m>x \lt 1</m> by <xref ref="lem_intreal_xsx">Lemma</xref>.
            Since <m>x \in B</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>1</m> is an upper bound of <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>a \geq 1</m> then <m>(1/2)^2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4 \lt 1 \leq a</m> so that <m>1/2 \in B</m>
            (and of course <m>1/2</m> is positive).
            Now consider any <m>x \in B</m> so that <m>x^2 \lt a</m>.
            If <m>x \leq 1</m> then <m>x \leq 1 \leq a</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>x > 1</m> then <m>x^2 = x \cdot x > 1 \cdot x = x</m> since
            <m>x > 1 > 0</m> so that <m>x \lt x^2 \lt a</m>.
            Thus in both cases <m>x \leq a</m> so that <m>a</m> is an upper bound of <m>B</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore in each case <m>B</m> contains a positive element
            (so that <m>b \neq \es</m>)
            and <m>B</m> is bounded above.
            It then follows that <m>B</m> has a least upper bound <m>b</m>
            (so that <m>b = \sup{B}</m>).
            Clearly since <m>B</m> has a positive element <m>x</m>,
            it follows that <m>0 \lt x \leq b</m> so that <m>b</m> is positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>b^2 \lt a</m>.
            Then by definition <m>b \in B</m> so that <m>b</m> has to be the largest element of <m>b</m> since it is the least upper bound.
            Since we know that <m>b</m> is positive and <m>b^2 \lt a</m>,
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(b) that there is an <m>h > 0</m> where
            <m>(b+h)^2 \lt a</m> and hence <m>b+h \in B</m>.
            However, since <m>h>0</m>, it follows that <m>b \lt b+h</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>b</m> is the greatest element of <m>B</m>.
            Hence it cannot be that <m>b^2 \lt a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So suppose that <m>b^2 > a</m>.
            Then again by part<nbsp/>(b) there is an <m>h</m> where
            <m>0 \lt h \lt b</m> such that <m>(b-h)^2 > a</m>.
            Now, since <m>h> 0</m>, it follows that
            <m>b-h \lt b</m> so that <m>n-h</m> is not an upper bound of <m>B</m>
            (since then <m>b</m> would not be the least upper bound).
            Hence there is an <m>x \in B</m> such that <m>b-h \lt x</m>,
            noting that <m>x^2 \lt a</m> by the definition of <m>B</m>.
            Since <m>h \lt b</m>, we have that <m>0 \lt b - h \lt x</m> so that
            <m>(b-h)^2 \lt x^2 \lt a</m> by <xref ref="lem_intreal_ysx">Lemma</xref>.
            But this contradicts the established fact that
            <m>(b-h)^2 > a</m> so that it cannot be that <m>b^2 > a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus the only possibility remaining is that <m>b^2 = a</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are positive and that <m>b^2 = c^2</m>.
            If it were the case that <m>b \lt c</m> then <m>0 \lt b \lt c</m> so that
            <m>0 \lt b^2 \lt c^2</m> by <xref ref="lem_intreal_ysx">Lemma</xref>
            so that clearly <m>b^2 \neq c^2</m>.
            As this is a contradiction, it has to be that <m>b \geq c</m>.
            An analogous argument shows that <m>b > c</m> also leads to a contradiction so that <m>b \leq c</m>.
            Hence it must be that <m>b = c</m> as desired.

            Suppose that <m>a > 0</m> is rational.
            Then <m>a = p/q</m> for some integers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>.
            Clearly it cannot be that <m>q = 0</m>,
            and if <m>q \lt 0</m> then <m>q = -b</m> for some <m>b \in \pints</m>.
            Then we have <m>a = p/q = p/(-b) = (-p)/b</m> so that <m>ab = -p</m>.
            Furthermore, since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both positive,
            we have that <m>ab = -p</m> is positive by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(h).
            Thus clearly <m>-p \in \pints</m> since <m>p \in \ints</m>.

          <p>
            Now, let <m>X = \braces{x \in \pints \where a x \in \pints}</m>.
            Since we just showed that <m>b \in \pints</m> and
            <m>a b = -p \in \pints</m> it follows that <m>b \in X</m>.
            Since clearly <m>X \ss \pints</m> and <m>X</m> is nonempty
            (since <m>b \in X</m>),
            it has a smallest element <m>n</m> by the well-ordering property.
            Letting <m>m = an</m>, we clearly have that
            <m>m \in \pints</m> since <m>n \in X</m>.
            Then, we have <m>a = m/n</m>,
            noting again that <m>m,n \in \pints</m>.

          <p>
            To show that not both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are even,
            suppose to the contrary that they <em>are</em> both even.
            Then by <xref ref="lem_intreal_even">Lemma</xref>
            we have that <m>m = 2k</m> and <m>n = 2l</m> for some <m>k,l \in \ints</m>.
            Clearly then <m>k = m/2</m> and <m>l = n/2</m> so that both <m>k</m> and <m>l</m> are positive by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(h) since <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>
            (and <m>1/2</m>)
            are.
            Hence <m>k,l \in \pints</m>.
            We have <m>a = m/n = 2k/2l = k/l</m> so that <m>al = k</m>,
            which implies that <m>l \in X</m> since <m>l</m> and <m>al=k</m> are both in <m>\pints</m>.
            However, we also have that <m>l = n/2 \lt n</m> since <m>n > 0</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>n</m> is the smallest element of <m>X</m>.
            Thus it has to be the case that not both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are even.

          (d) This is one of the most famous proofs in all of mathematics,

          <p>
            Obviously we take <m>\sqrt{2}</m> to be the unique positive real number such that
            <m>(\sqrt{2})^2 = 2</m> as was shown to exist in Exercise<nbsp/>4.10.
            Suppose to the contrary that
            <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational so that <m>\sqrt{2} = a/b</m> for
            <m>a,b \in \pints</m> where not both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are even by part<nbsp/>(c) since <m>\sqrt{2} > 0</m>.
            We therefore have that <m>2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = (a/b)^2 = a^2 / b^2</m> so that <m>2b^2 = a^2</m>.
            Since <m>b^2</m> is an integer (clearly,
            since <m>b</m> is and <m>b^2 = b \cdot b</m>) it follows from <xref ref="lem_intreal_even">Lemma</xref> that <m>a^2</m> is even.
            This means that <m>a</m> itself is even by <xref ref="lem_intreal_squodd">Lemma</xref>.
            Hence <m>a = 2n</m> for some integer <m>n</m> so that <m>a^2 = (2n)^2 = 4n^2</m>.
            From before,
            we then have <m>2b^2 = a^2 = 4n^2</m> so that clearly <m>b^2 = 2n^2</m>,
            from which it follows as before that <m>b^2</m> and therefore <m>b</m> itself is even by <xref ref="lem_intreal_even">Lemmas</xref>
            and <xref ref="lem_intreal_squodd"></xref>.
            However, this is a contradiction since we previously established that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> cannot both be even!
            So it has to be that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is not rational and is therefore irrational as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            We define a function <m>f: A \times B \to B \times A</m>.
            For any element <m>(a,b) \in A \times B</m> we set <m>f(a,b) = (b,a)</m>,
            noting that of course <m>a \in A</m> and <m>b \in B</m>.
            It should be obvious then that <m>f(a,b) = (b,a) \in B \times A</m> so that
            <m>B \times A</m> can be the range of <m>f</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>f</m> is injective.
            To this end consider <m>\opx</m> and <m>\opy</m> in
            <m>A \times B</m> where <m>\opx \neq \opy</m>.
            Of course we have that <m>f\opx = \pox</m> and <m>f\opy = \poy</m>.
            Since <m>\opx \neq \opy</m> clearly either
            <m>a_1 \neq a_2</m> or <m>b_1 \neq b_2</m>.
            In either case it should be clear that <m>f\opx = \pox \neq \poy = f\opy</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>\opx</m> and <m>\opy</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very easy to that <m>f</m> is also surjective since,
            for any <m>(b,a) \in B \times A</m>,
            clearly <m>(a,b) \in A \times B</m> and <m>f(a,b) = (b,a)</m>.
            Hence <m>f</m> is a bijection as desired.
            Note that if <m>A \times B = \es</m> then <m>f = \es</m> as well,
            which is vacuously a bijective function since it must be that <m>B \times A = \es</m> as well
            (because either <m>A = \es</m> or <m>B = \es</m>).

        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, suppose that <m>n \in \pints</m> is even.
            Then by definition <m>n/2</m> is an integer.
            However, since both <m>n</m> and <m>1/2</m> are positive,
            it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(h) that
            <m>n \cdot (1/2) = n/2</m> is positive also so that <m>n/2 \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, suppose that <m>n \in \pints</m> is odd so that
            <m>n = 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>4.11a.
            Then
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{n+1}{2} = \frac{(2k + 1) + 1}{2} = \frac{2k + 2}{2} = \frac{2(k+1)}{2} = k+1 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is clearly an integer since <m>k</m> is.
            Moreover, we have <m>n+1 > n > 0</m> since
            <m>n \in \pints</m> and again <m>1/2 > 0</m> so that
            <m>(n+1) \cdot (1/2) = (n+1)/2</m> is positive by Exercise<nbsp/>4.2 part<nbsp/>(h).
            Thus <m>(n+1)/2 \in \pints</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            For brevity,
            let <m>X = A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n</m> and <m>Y = \parens{A_1 \times \cdots \times A_{n-1}} \times A_n</m>.
            Suppose that <m>n > 1</m> so that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> make sense.
            We construct a bijective function <m>f: X \to Y</m>.
            For any <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{n} \in X</m> we have that
            <m>x_i \in A_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>.
            So set <m>f(x) = (\seqfin{x}{n-1}, x_n)</m>,
            which is clearly an element of <m>Y</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see that <m>f</m> is injective consider <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{n}</m> and
            <m>\vy = \seqfin{y}{n}</m> in <m>X</m> where <m>\vx \neq \vy</m>.
            It then follows that there must be an
            <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> where <m>x_i \neq y_i</m>.
            Let <m>\vx' = \seqfin{x}{n-1}</m> and <m>\vy' = \seqfin{y}{n-1}</m> so that clearly
            <m>f(\vx) = (\vx', x_n)</m> and <m>f(\vy) = (\vy', y_n)</m>.
            Now, if <m>i = n</m>, then clearly
            <m>f(\vx) = (\vx', x_n) \neq (\vy', y_n) = f(\vy)</m> since <m>x_n = x_i \neq y_i = y_n</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>i \neq n</m> then it has to be that <m>i \lt n</m>,
            and hence <m>i \leq n-1</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\vx' = \seqfin{x}{n-1} \neq \seqfin{y}{n-1} = \vy'</m> so that then <m>f(\vx) = (\vx', x_n) \neq (\vy', y_n) = f(\vy)</m> again.
            Since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f</m> is indeed injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vy = (\seqfin{x}{n-1}, x_n) \in Y</m> and let <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{n}</m>.
            It should be obvious that both <m>\vx \in X</m> and
            <m>f(\vx) = \vy</m> so that <m>f</m> is surjective.
            Hence <m>f</m> is a bijective function as desired.

        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First let <m>A = A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots</m> and <m>B = B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots</m>.
            We construct a bijective <m>f: A \to B</m>.
            So, for any <m>\va \in A</m>,
            we have that <m>\va = \seqinf{a}</m>,
            where <m>a_i \in A_i</m> for any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then, for any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            define <m>b_i = (a_{2i-1}, a_{2i})</m> so that clearly <m>b_i \in A_{2i-1} \times A_{2i} = B_i</m>.
            We then have that <m>\vb = \seqinf{b} \in B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots = B</m>.
            So set <m>f(\va) = \vb</m> so that <m>f</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective,
            consider <m>\va = \seqinf{a}</m> and
            <m>\va' = \seqinf{a'}</m> in <m>A</m> where <m>\va \neq \va'</m>.
            For each <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            define <m>b_i = (a_{2i-1}, a_{2i})</m> and <m>b_i' = (a_{2i-1}', a_{2i}')</m> as above and set
            <m>\vb = \seqinf{b}</m> and <m>\vb' = \seqinf{b'}</m> so that clearly
            <m>f(\va) = \vb</m> and <m>f(\va') = \vb'</m>.
            Since <m>\va \neq \va'</m>,
            it follows that there must be an
            <m>i \in \pints</m> where <m>a_i \neq a_i'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>i</m> is even.
            Then let <m>j = i/2</m> so that
            <m>j \in \pints</m> by <xref ref="lem_cartp_eopints">Lemma</xref>.
            We also clearly have that <m>i = 2j</m> so that
            <m>b_j = (a_{2j-1}, a_{2j}) \neq (a_{2j-1}', a_{2j}') = b_j'</m> since <m>a_{2j} = a_i \neq a_i' = a_{2j}'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>i</m> is odd.
            Then let <m>j = (i+1)/2</m> so that
            <m>j \in \pints</m> by <xref ref="lem_cartp_eopints">Lemma</xref>.
            We then clearly have that <m>i = 2j-1</m> so that
            <m>b_j = (a_{2j-1}, a_{2j}) \neq (a_{2j-1}', a_{2j}') = b_j'</m> since <m>a_{2j-1} = a_i \neq a_i' = a_{2j-1}'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in all cases we have that there is a
            <m>j \in \pints</m> where <m>b_j \neq b_j'</m>.
            It then follows that <m>f(\va) = \vb = \seqinf{b} \neq \seqinf{b'} = \vb' = f(\va')</m> so that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>\va</m> and <m>\va'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, to show that <m>f</m> is surjective,
            consider any <m>\vb \in B</m> so that <m>\vb = \seqinf{b}</m> where
            <m>b_i \in B_i = A_{2i-1} \times A_{2i}</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then, for any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            <m>b_i = (a_i', a_i'')</m> where
            <m>a_i' \in A_{2i-1}</m> and <m>a_i'' \in A_{2i}</m>.
            So consider any <m>j \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>j</m> is even,
            then <m>i = j/2 \in \pints</m> by <xref ref="lem_cartp_eopints">Lemma</xref>.
            Clearly also <m>j = 2i</m>.
            So, define <m>a_j = a_i''</m> so that <m>a_j = a_{2i} = a_i'' \in A_{2i} = A_j</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>j</m> is odd,
            then <m>i = (j+1)/2 \in \pints</m> again by <xref ref="lem_cartp_eopints">Lemma</xref>.
            Then clearly <m>j = 2i-1</m>.
            So, here let <m>a_j = a_i'</m> so that <m>a_j = a_{2i-1} = a_i' \in A_{2i-1} = A_j</m>.
            Hence <m>a_j \in A_j</m> for all
            <m>j \in \pints</m> so that <m>\va = \seqinf{a} \in A</m>.
            Then, for any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            we have <m>b_i = (a_i', a_i'') = (a_{2i-1}, a_{2i}) \in A_{2i-1} \times A_{2i} = B_i</m> so that by definition <m>f(\va) = \vb = \seqinf{b}</m>.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>\vb</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the proof that <m>f</m> is bijective so that the desired result follows.

              <mrow>b_j = \begin{cases}b_0 \amp  j = i \\ b_j' \amp  j \neq i \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>j \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>b_j \in B_j</m> for any
            <m>j \in \pints</m> so that <m>\vb = \seqinf{b} \in B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots = B</m>.
            It then follows that also <m>\vb \in A</m> since <m>B \ss A</m>.
            Hence <m>b_j \in A_j</m> for every <m>j \in \pints</m>.
            In particular, we have <m>b_0 = b_i \in A_i</m>.
            Since <m>b_0</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>B_i \ss A_i</m>,
            and since <m>i</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows the desired result.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is nonempty so that there is an <m>\va \in A</m>.
            Then, since <m>A = A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots</m>,
            it follows that <m>\va = \seqinf{a}</m> where
            <m>a_i \in A_i</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Therefore, for any such <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            we have that <m>a_i \in A_i</m> so that <m>A_i \neq \es</m>.
            Hence every <m>A_i</m> is nonempty as desired since <m>i</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Consider the converse.
          Suppose that each <m>A_i</m> is nonempty
          (for <m>i \in \pints</m>).
          Then there is an <m>a_i \in A_i</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m> so that
          <m>\va = \seqinf{a} \in A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots = A</m> so that then <m>A \neq \es</m>.
          While this may seem like an innocuous argument,
          especially out of the context of axiomatic set theory,
          it actually requires the Axiom of Choice.
          The reason is that,
          in the general case when each <m>A_i</m> may have more than one element,
          or even an infinite number of elements,
          we have to choose a specific <m>a_i</m> in each <m>A_i</m>.
          Since the index set <m>\pints</m> is infinite,
          an infinite number of these choices must be made,
          which is precisely when the Axiom of Choice is required.
          If the index set was finite, then the axiom would not be needed.

          (d) First, let <m>C_i = A_i \cup B_i</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m>,
          and let <m>C = C_1 \times C_2 \times \cdots</m>,
          so that we are asked to compare <m>C</m> with <m>A \cup B</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>A \cup B \ss C</m> but that <m>C</m> is <em>not</em>
          generally a subset of <m>A \cup B</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>\vx \in A \cup B</m> so that <m>\vx \in A</m> or <m>x \in B</m>.
            If <m>\vx \in A</m> then it has to be that <m>\vx = \seqinf{x}</m> where
            <m>x_i \in A_i</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Consider then any such <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then <m>x_i \in A_i</m> so that clearly <m>x_i \in A_i \cup B_i = C_i</m>.
            Since <m>i</m> was arbitrary,
            we conclude that <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in C_1 \times C_2 \times \cdots = C</m>.
            An analogous argument shows that
            <m>\vx \in C</m> when <m>\vx \in B</m> as well.
            Hence <m>A \cup B \ss C</m> since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>C</m> is <em>not</em>
            a subset of <m>A \cup B</m> in general,
            consider the following counterexample.
            Let <m>A_1 = \es</m> and <m>A_i = \braces{1}</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m> where <m>i > 1</m>.
            Also let <m>B_i = \braces{2}</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Now, it follows from the contrapositive of part<nbsp/>(c) that <m>A = \es</m> since <m>A_1 = \es</m>.
            We also clearly have <m>B = B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots = \braces{(2, 2, \ldots)}</m> so that <m>A \cup B = \es \cup B = B = \braces{(2, 2, \ldots)}</m>.
            Clearly <m>C_1 = A_1 \cup B_1 = \es \cup \braces{2} = \braces{2}</m> while,
            for <m>i > 1</m> we have <m>C_i = A_i \cup B_i = \braces{1} \cup \braces{2} = \braces{1,2}</m>.
            It then follows that,
            for <m>a_1 = 2</m> and <m>a_i = 1</m> for <m>i > 1</m>,
            we have <m>\va = \seqinf{a} = (2, 1, 1, \ldots) \in C_1 \times C_2 \times \cdots = C</m>.
            However, clearly <m>\va \notin A \cup B</m>,
            which suffices to show that <m>C</m> cannot be a subset of <m>A \cup B</m> in general.

          Now let <m>C_i = A_i \cap B_i</m> for every
          <m>i \in \pints</m> so that we are asked to compare <m>C = C_1 \times C_2 \times \cdots</m> and <m>A \cap B</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we claim that in fact <m>A \cap B = C</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>\vx \in A \cap B</m> so that
            <m>\vx \in A</m> and <m>\vx \in B</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\vx = \seqinf{x}</m> where
            <m>x_i \in A_i</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m> and
            <m>x_i \in B_i</m> for every <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then, for any such <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            clearly <m>x_i \in A_i</m> and
            <m>x_i \in B_i</m> so that <m>x_i \in A_i \cap B_i = C_i</m>.
            We then have that <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in C_1 \times C_2 \times \cdots = C</m>.
            Since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>A \cap B \ss C</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vx \in C</m> so that <m>\vx = \seqinf{x}</m> where
            <m>x_i \in C_i</m> for any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then, for any such <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            we have <m>x_i \in C_i = A_i \cap B_i</m> so that
            <m>x_i \in A_i</m> and <m>x_i \in B_i</m>.
            Since <m>i</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that both <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots = A</m> and <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots = B</m>.
            Hence <m>\vx \in A \cap B</m>,
            which shows that <m>C \ss A \cap B</m> since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore it must be that <m>A \cap B = C</m> as desired.

            Suppose that <m>m \leq n</m>.
            Since <m>X \neq \es</m>, there is an <m>x_0 \in X</m>.
            Now, for any <m>\vx \in X^m</m> we have that
            <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{m}</m> where each <m>x_i \in X</m>.
            Then define

            Clearly <m>y_i \in X</m> for every

            we have <m>y_i = x_i \neq x_i' = y_i'</m> by the definition of <m>f</m>.

            Then define

            for any <m>k \in \intsfin{m+n}</m>,
            noting that for <m>m \lt  k \leq m+n</m> we have <m>m+1 \leq k \leq m+n</m>,
            and hence <m>1 \leq k-m \leq n</m> so that <m>b_{k-m}</m> is defined.
            Now set <m>g(\vx) = \vy = \seqfin{y}{m+n}</m> so that clearly
            <m>g(\vx) \in X^{m+n}</m> since each <m>y_k \in X</m>.
            Thus <m>g</m> is a function from <m>X^m \times X^n</m> to <m>X^{m+n}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> is injective,
            consider any <m>\vx = (\va, \vb)</m> and <m>\vx' = (\va', \vb')</m> in
            <m>X^m \times X^n</m> where <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>.
            Also let <m>\vy = \seqfin{y}{m+n} = g(\vx)</m> and <m>\vy' = \seqfin{y'}{m+n} = g(\vx')</m>.
            Since <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            it must be that <m>\va \neq \va'</m> or <m>\vb \neq \vb'</m>.
            In the former case we have that <m>\va = \seqfin{a}{m}</m> and
            <m>\va' = \seqfin{a'}{m}</m> since they are both in <m>X^m</m>.
            Since <m>\va \neq \va'</m> there is an
            <m>i \in \intsfin{m}</m> where <m>a_i \neq a_i'</m>.
            Then, since clearly <m>1 \leq i \leq m</m>,
            we have that <m>y_i = a_i \neq a_i' = y_i'</m>.
            In the latter case we have that <m>\vb = \seqfin{b}{n}</m> and
            <m>\vb' = \seqfin{b'}{n}</m> since they are both in <m>X^n</m>.
            Then, since <m>\vb \neq \vb'</m>,
            we have that there is an <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> such that <m>b_i \neq b_i'</m>.
            Let <m>k = m+i</m> so that clearly <m>k-m = i</m>.
            Also <m>m \lt m+i = k \leq m+n</m> since
            <m>0 \lt 1 \leq i \leq n</m> so that <m>y_k = b_{k-m} = b_i \neq b_i' = b_{k-m}' = y_k'</m>.
            Hence in both cases there is a <m>k \in \intsfin{m+n}</m> such that
            <m>y_k \neq y_k'</m> so that <m>g(\vx) = \vy = \seqfin{y}{m+n} \neq \seqfin{y'}{m+n} = \vy' = g(\vx')</m>.
            Since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>g</m> is indeed injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vy = \seqfin{y}{m+n} \in X^{m+n}</m>,

            <m>b_j = y_{m+j}</m> for any <m>j \in \intsfin{n}</m>,
            noting that <m>y_{m+j}</m> is defined since
            <m>0 \lt 1 \leq j \leq n</m> implies that <m>m \lt m+j \leq m+n</m>.
            Then let <m>\va = \seqfin{a}{m}</m>,
            <m>\vb = \seqfin{b}{n}</m>,
            and <m>\vx = (\va,\vb)</m> so that clearly <m>\vx \in X^m \times X^n</m>.
            Let <m>\vy' = g(\vx)</m> as defined above so that <m>\vy' = \seqfin{y'}{m+n}</m>.
            Consider any <m>k \in \intsfin{m+n}</m>.
            If <m>1 \leq k \leq m</m> then we have by the definition of <m>g</m> that <m>y_k' = a_k = y_k</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>m \lt k \leq m+n</m>,
            then we have <m>y_k' = b_{k-m} = y_{m+(k-m)} = y_k</m>.
            Thus in both cases <m>y_k' = y_k</m> so that clearly
            <m>g(\vx) = \vy' = \seqfin{y'}{m+n} = \seqfin{y}{m+n} = \vy</m> since <m>k</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First, we know that <m>X \neq \es</m> so that there is an <m>x_0 \in X</m>.
            So, for any <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{n} \in X^n</m>, define
            <md>
              <mrow>y_i = \begin{cases}x_i \amp  1 \leq i \leq n \\ x_0 \amp  n \lt  i \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Then set <m>h(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y}</m> so that clearly <m>h(\vx) \in X^\w</m>.
            Thus <m>h</m> is a function that maps <m>X^n</m> into <m>X^\w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>h</m> is injective,
            consider <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> in <m>X^n</m> where <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{n}</m> and <m>\vx' = \seqfin{x'}{n}</m>,
            and let <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} = h(\vx)</m> and <m>\vy' = \seqinf{y'} = h(\vx')</m>.
            Since <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            there must an <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> where <m>x_i \neq x_i'</m>.
            Then we have <m>y_i = x_i \neq x_i' = y_i'</m> by the definition of <m>h</m> since obviously <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>.
            It then follows that <m>h(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y} \neq \seqinf{y'} = \vy' = h(\vx')</m>,
            which shows that <m>h</m> is injective since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> were arbitrary.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>\vx = (\va,\vb) \in X^n \times X^\w</m> so that clearly
            <m>\va = \seqfin{a}{n} \in X^n</m> and <m>\vb = \seqinf{b} \in X^\w</m>.
            Then define the sequence
            <md>
              <mrow>y_i = \begin{cases}a_i \amp  1 \leq i \leq n \\ b_{i-n} \amp  n \lt  i \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            noting that when <m>n \lt  i</m> we have <m>n+1 \leq i</m> so that
            <m>1 \leq i-n</m> so that <m>b_{i-n}</m> is defined.
            We then of course set <m>k(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y}</m> so that clearly <m>k(\vx) \in X^\w</m>.
            Therefore <m>k</m> is a function from <m>X^n \times X^\w</m> to <m>X^\w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>k</m> is injective consider <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> in
            <m>X^n \times X^\w</m> where <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>.
            Of course we have <m>\vx = (\va,\vb)</m> and <m>\vx' = (\va',\vb')</m> where
            <m>\va,\va' \in X^n</m> while <m>\vb,\vb' \in X^\w</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\va = \seqfin{a}{n}</m>,
            <m>\va' = \seqfin{a'}{n}</m>,
            <m>\vb = \seqinf{b}</m>,
            and <m>\vb' = \seqinf{b'}</m>, where every <m>a_i</m>,
            <m>a_i'</m>, <m>b_j</m>, and <m>b_j'</m> are in <m>X</m>
            (for <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> and <m>j \in \pints</m>).
            Also, let <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} = k(\vx)</m> and <m>\vy' = \seqinf{y'} = k(\vx')</m>.
            Now, since <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            we have that either <m>\va \neq \va'</m> or <m>\vb \neq \vb'</m>.
            If <m>\va \neq \va'</m> then there is an
            <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> where <m>a_i \neq a_i'</m>.
            We then have that <m>y_i = a_i \neq a_i' = y_i'</m> by the definition of <m>k</m>,
            since obviously <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>.
            If, on the other hand, <m>\vb \neq \vb'</m>,
            then there is an <m>i \in \pints</m> such that <m>b_i \neq b_i'</m>.
            Then clearly <m>n \lt n+i</m> since <m>0 \lt i</m> so that <m>y_{n+i} = b_{(n+i)-n} = b_i \neq b_i' = b_{(n+i)-n}' = y_{n+i}'</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>n+i \in \pints</m>.
            Hence in either case there is an <m>i \in \pints</m> such that
            <m>y_i \neq y_i'</m> so that <m>k(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y} \neq \seqinf{y'} = \vy' = k(\vx')</m>.
            This shows that <m>k</m> is injective since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} \in X^\w</m> and set <m>a_i = y_i</m> for any
            <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> so that clearly <m>\va = \seqfin{a}{n} \in X^n</m>.
            Also, for any <m>j \in \pints</m>,
            let <m>b_j = y_{n+j}</m> so that clearly <m>\vb = \seqinf{b} \in X^\w</m>.
            Let <m>\vx = (\va,\vb)</m> so that clearly <m>x \in X^n \times X^\w</m>.
            Now set <m>\vy' = \seqinf{y'} = k(\vx)</m> as defined above.
            Consider any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> then
            <m>y_i' = a_i = y_i</m> by the definition of <m>k</m>.
            If <m>n \lt i</m> then <m>y_i' = b_{i-n} = y_{n+(i-n)} = y_i</m>.
            Hence <m>y_i' = y_i</m> for every
            <m>i \in \pints</m> so that <m>k(\vx) = \vy' = \seqinf{y'} = \seqinf{y} = \vy</m>,
            which shows that <m>k</m> is surjective since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the proof that <m>k</m> is bijective.

            Consider any <m>\vx = (\va,\vb) \in X^\w \times X^\w</m> so that clearly
            <m>\va = \seqinf{a}</m> and <m>\vb = \seqinf{b}</m>.
            Now define
            <md>
              <mrow>y_i = \begin{cases}a_{i/2} \amp  \text{ \(i\) is even }  \\ b_{(i+1)/2} \amp  \text{ \(i\) is odd } \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Note that <m>i/2</m> and <m>(i+1)/2</m> are in <m>\pints</m> if <m>i</m> is even or odd,
            respectively by <xref ref="lem_cartp_eopints">Lemma</xref>
            so that <m>y_i</m> is defined.
            Clearly we have that <m>y_i \in X</m> for any
            <m>i \in \pints</m> so that <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} \in X^\w</m>.
            Setting <m>l(\vx) = \vy</m>,
            we then have that <m>l</m> is a function from <m>X^\w \times X^\w</m> to <m>X^\w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>l</m> is injective,
            consider <m>\vx = (\va, \vb)</m> and <m>\vx' = (\va', \vb')</m> in
            <m>X^\w \times X^\w</m> where <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>.
            Also set <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} = l(\vx)</m> and <m>\vy' = \seqinf{y'} = l(\vx')</m>.
            Since <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            we have that either <m>\va \neq \va'</m> or <m>\vb \neq \vb'</m>.
            If <m>\va \neq \va'</m> then there is an
            <m>i \in \pints</m> such that <m>a_i \neq a_i'</m>.
            Then, since clearly <m>2i</m> is even,
            we have <m>y_{2i} = a_{(2i)/2} = a_i \neq a_i' = a_{(2i)/2}' = y_{2i}'</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>\vb \neq \vb'</m> then there is a
            <m>j \in \pints</m> where <m>b_j \neq b_j'</m>.
            Set <m>k = 2j-1</m>, noting that
            <md>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq j</mrow>
              <mrow>2 \amp \leq 2j</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq 2j-1</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq k</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>k \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly also <m>(k+1)/2 = j</m>.
            Since obviously <m>k</m> is odd,
            we have <m>y_k = b_{(k+1)/2} = b_j \neq b_j' = b_{(k+1)/2}' = y_k'</m>.
            Hence in both cases we have that there is a <m>k \in \pints</m> where
            <m>y_k \neq y_k'</m> so that <m>l(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y} \neq \seqinf{y'} = \vy' = l(\vx')</m>.
            Since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>l</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} \in X^\w</m>.
            For any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            define <m>a_i = y_{2i}</m> and <m>b_i = y_{2i-1}</m>,
            noting again that <m>2i-1 \in \pints</m>
            (and clearly <m>2i \in \pints</m>).
            Then set <m>\va = \seqinf{a}</m>,
            <m>\vb = \seqinf{b}</m>, and <m>\vx = (\va, \vb)</m>.
            Now let <m>\vy' = \seqinf{y'} = l(\vx)</m> and consider any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>i</m> is even then we have by the definition of <m>l</m> that <m>y_i' = a_{i/2} = y_{2(i/2)} = y_i</m>.
            If <m>i</m> is odd then let
            <m>j = (i+1)/2</m> so that clearly <m>i = 2j-1</m>.
            Then <m>y_i' = b_{(i+1)/2} = b_j = y_{2j-1} = y_i</m>.
            Hence in either case we have <m>y_i' = y_i</m> so that
            <m>l(\vx) = \vy' = \seqinf{y'} = \seqinf{y} = \vy</m> since <m>i</m> was arbitrary.
            Since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>l</m> is surjective.

            Then let <m>x_{ij} = \vx_i(j)</m> for <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> and
            <m>j \in \pints</m> so that clearly <m>x_{ij} \in A</m>,
            from which it follows that each

            Consider any <m>k \in \pints</m>.
            Since <m>n \neq 0</m>
            (since <m>n \in \pints</m>),
            it follows from the Division Theorem from algebra that there are unique integers <m>q</m> and
            <m>0 \leq r \lt n</m> where <m>k = qn + r</m>.
            Suppose for a moment that <m>q \lt 0</m> so that <m>q+1 \leq 0</m>.
            Then we have that <m>k = qn + r \lt qn + n = (q+1)n \leq 0 \cdot n = 0 \lt k</m>
            (since <m>k \in \pints</m>)
            since <m>r \lt n</m> and <m>n > 0</m> (so that
            <m>(q+1)n \leq 0 \cdot n</m> since <m>q+1 \leq 0</m>).
            This is of course a contradiction so that it must be that <m>q \geq 0</m>.
            Then set <m>i = r+1 \geq 1</m> and <m>j = q+1 \geq 1</m> so that

            <m>y_k \in B</m> since <m>x_{ij}</m> is.
            It then follows that <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} \in B^\w</m>.
            Then set <m>m(\vx) = \vy</m> so that clearly <m>m</m> is a function from <m>\parens{A^\w}^n</m> to <m>B^\w</m>.

            Then <m>\vx = \seqfin{\vx}{n}</m> and

            As before set <m>x_{ij} = \vx_i(j)</m> and <m>x_{ij}' = \vx_i'(j)</m> for

            Now, since <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            there is an <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m> where <m>\vx_i \neq \vx_i'</m>.

            Now let <m>k = (j-1)n + (i-1)</m> so that it follows from the definition of <m>m</m> that <m>y_k = x_{ij}</m> and

            Then, for any <m>i \in \pints</m> clearly
            <m>x_i \in Y_i</m> by definition since <m>x_i \geq i</m>
            (and also <m>x_i \in \reals</m>).
            Hence it follows that <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in Y_1 \times Y_2 \times \cdots = Y</m>.

            Consider any such <m>i \in \pints</m> so that <m>x_i \in Y_i</m>.

            Since <m>i</m> was arbitrary,

          (and <m>i \in \pints</m> for both),
          noting that of course <m>Y_i \ss \reals</m> for either case.

            Consider any <m>\vx \in X</m> so that

            Suppose <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>i \lt 100</m> then clearly
            <m>x_i \in \reals = Y_i</m> since <m>\vx \in \reals^\w</m>.
            If <m>i \geq 100</m> then we have that <m>x_i \in \ints = Y_i</m>.
            Hence in either case <m>x_i \in Y_i</m> so that
            <m>\vx \in Y_1 \times Y_2 \times \cdots = Y</m> since <m>i</m> was arbitrary.

            Then <m>x_i \in Y_i = \ints</m> so that <m>x_i</m> is an integer.
            From this it follows that <m>\vx \in X</m> by definition since obviously <m>\vx \in \reals^\w</m>
            (since <m>x_i \in Y_i = \reals</m> when <m>i \lt 100</m>).
            Hence <m>Y \ss X</m> since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose to the contrary that there are <m>X_i \ss \reals</m> for
            <m>i \in \pints</m> where <m>X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots</m>.
            Let <m>(a, a, \ldots)</m> denote the sequence
            <m>\seqinf{x}</m> where <m>x_i = a</m> for all <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            We then have that <m>(1, 1, \ldots)</m> and
            <m>(2, 2, \ldots)</m> are both in <m>X</m> since clearly <m>x_2 = x_3</m> in both.
            Hence we have that <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> are both in <m>X_i</m> for every
            <m>i \in \pints</m> since <m>X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots</m>.
            Now define
            <md>
              <mrow>y_i = \begin{cases}1 \amp  i \neq 2 \\ 2 \amp  i = 2 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly <m>\vy = \seqinf{y} \in X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots</m> since both <m>1</m> and <m>2</m> are in each <m>X_i</m>.
            However, it is also clear that
            <m>\vy \notin X</m> by definition since <m>y_2 = 2 \neq 1 = y_3</m>.
            This contradicts the fact that <m>X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots</m>,
            which shows the desired result.

          <p>
            We fix <m>n</m> and show this for all <m>m \leq n</m> by induction.
            First, for <m>m=1</m>, the domain of the mappings is simply
            <m>\braces{1}</m> so that we need only choose a single element to which to map <m>1</m>.
            Since there are <m>n</m> elements to choose from
            (since the range is <m>\intsfin{n}</m>)
            there are clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>n = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!} = \frac{n!}{(n-m)!}</mrow>
            </md>
            mappings, all of which are trivially injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>m \lt  n</m> and that there are
            <m>n! / (n-m)!</m> injective mappings from
            <m>\intsfin{m}</m> to <m>\intsfin{n}</m>.
            Consider any such mapping <m>\seqfin{f}{m}</m>.
            Since this mapping is injective,
            each <m>f_i</m> is unique so that it uses <m>m</m> of the <m>n</m> available numbers in <m>\intsfin{n}</m>.
            Thus there are <m>n-m</m> numbers to choose from to which to set <m>f_{m+1}</m> so that the mapping <m>\seqfin{f}{m+1}</m> is still injective.
            Hence for each injective mapping
            <m>\seqfin{f}{m}</m> there are <m>n-m</m> injective mappings from
            <m>\intsfin{m+1}</m> to <m>\intsfin{n}</m>.
            Since there are <m>n!/(n-m)!</m> such mappings by the induction hypothesis,
            the total number of mappings from
            <m>\intsfin{m+1}</m> to <m>\intsfin{n}</m> will be
            <md>
              <mrow>\frac{n!}{(n-m)!}(n-m) = \frac{n!}{(n-m-1)!} = \frac{n!}{[n-(m+1)]!} \,</mrow>

          Note that they are all injective since no number is used more than once in each tuple.
          Also none are surjective since it is easily verified that there is always an element of
          <m>\braces{1,2,3,4}</m> that is not in each tuple.
          Thus none are a bijection since they are not surjective.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>B</m> is not finite and <m>B \ss A</m> but that <m>A</m> <em>is</em> finite.
            Since <m>B \ss A</m>,
            either <m>B = A</m> or <m>B</m> is a proper subset of <m>A</m>.
            In the former case we clearly have a contradiction since <m>B</m> would be finite since <m>A</m> is and <m>B = A</m>.
            In the latter case we have that there is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>\intsfin{n}</m> for some
            <m>n \in \pints</m> by definition since <m>A</m> is finite.
            Then, since <m>B</m> is a proper subset of <m>A</m>,
            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>6.2 that there is a bijection from <m>B</m> to
            <m>\intsfin{m}</m> for some <m>m \lt n</m>.
            However, then clearly <m>B</m> is finite by definition,
            which is also a contradiction since we know <m>B</m> is not finite.
            Hence in either case there is a contradiction so that <m>A</m> must not be finite.

          Let <m>X</m> be the two-element set <m>\braces{0,1}</m>.
          Find a bijective correspondence between <m>X^\w</m> and a proper subset of itself.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>Y = \braces{\vx \in X^\w \where x_1 = 0}</m>,
            which is clearly a proper subset of <m>X^\w</m> since,
            for example,
            <m>(1,1,\ldots)</m> is in <m>X^\w</m> but not in <m>Y</m>.
            We construct a bijective function <m>f</m> from <m>X^\w</m> to <m>Y</m>.
            So consider any <m>\vx \in X^\w</m> and define
            <md>
              <mrow>y_i = \begin{cases}0 \amp  i = 1 \\ x_{i-1} \amp  i \neq 1 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            noting that when <m>i \neq 1</m> we have <m>i > 1</m> so that <m>i-1 \geq 1</m>,
            and thus <m>y_i = x_{i-1}</m> is defined.
            Now define <m>f(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y}</m> so that clearly <m>f</m> is a function from <m>X^\w</m> to <m>Y</m>,
            since <m>y_1 = 0</m> for any input <m>\vx</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective,
            consider <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> in <m>X^\w</m> where <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            and let <m>\vy = f(\vx)</m> and <m>\vy' = f(\vx')</m>.
            Now, since <m>\vx \neq \vx'</m>,
            there is an <m>i \in \pints</m> where <m>x_i \neq x_i'</m>.
            Since <m>i > 0</m>
            (since <m>i \in \pints</m>)
            it follows that <m>i+1 > 1</m> so that <m>i+1 \neq 1</m>.
            We then have by the definition of <m>f</m> that
            <m>y_{i+1} = x_{(i+1)-1} = x_i \neq x_i' = x_{(i+1)-1}' = y_{i+1}'</m> so that clearly <m>f(\vx) = \vy \neq \vy' = f(\vx')</m>.
            Since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f</m> is indeed injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vy \in Y</m> so that <m>y_1 = 0</m>.
            Define <m>x_i = y_{i+1}</m> for any
            <m>i \in \pints</m> and let <m>\vx = \seqinf{x}</m>.
            Then <m>\vx \in X^\w</m> since clearly each <m>x_i = y_{i+1} \in X</m>.
            Now let <m>\vy' = f(\vx)</m> and consider any <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>i = 1</m> then clearly <m>y_i' = y_1' = 0 = y_1 = y_i</m>
            (<m>y_1' = 0</m> since the range of <m>f</m> is <m>Y</m>).
            If <m>i \neq 1</m> then <m>y_i' = x_{i-1}' = y_{(i-1)+1} = y_i</m>.
            Hence <m>y_i' = y_i</m> in both cases so that
            <m>f(\vx) = \vy' = \vy</m> since <m>i</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore <m>f</m> is bijective as desired.

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show by induction that, for all <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            any simply ordered set with cardinality <m>n</m> has a largest element.
            This of course shows the result since, by definition,
            <m>A \neq \es</m> has cardinality <m>n</m> for some
            <m>n \in \pints</m> when <m>A</m> is finite.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, suppose that <m>A</m> is simply ordered and has cardinality 1 so that clearly
            <m>A = \braces{a}</m> for some element <m>a</m>.
            It is also clear that <m>a</m> is trivially the largest element of <m>A</m> since it is the only element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that any simply ordered set with cardinality <m>n</m> has a largest element.
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> and has cardinality <m>n+1</m>.
            Then there is a bijection <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>\intsfin{n+1}</m>,
            noting that obviously <m>\inv{f}</m> is also a bijection.
            Clearly <m>A</m> is nonempty
            (since the cardinality of <m>A</m> is <m>n+1 > n > 0</m>)
            so that there is an <m>a \in A</m>.
            Let <m>A' = A-\braces{a}</m> so that <m>A'</m> has cardinality <m>n</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>6.1.
            Note also that clearly <m>A'</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> as well (technically we must restrict <m>\prec</m> to elements of <m>A'</m> so that it is really ordered by <m>\prec \cap (A' \times A')</m>).
            It then follows that <m>A'</m> has a largest element <m>b</m> by the induction hypothesis.
            Since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> must be comparable in <m>\prec</m> by the definition of a simple order we have the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a = b</m>.
            This is not possible since
            <m>b \in A'</m> but clearly <m>a \notin A - \braces{a} = A'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a \prec b</m>.
            We claim that <m>b</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            To see this,
            consider any <m>x \in A</m> so that either <m>x = a</m> or <m>x \in A'</m>.
            In the former case clearly <m>x = a \prece b</m>,
            and in the latter <m>x \prece b</m> since <m>b</m> is the largest element of <m>A'</m>.
            This shows that <m>b</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>b \prec a</m>.
            We claim that <m>a</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>x = a</m> or <m>x \in A'</m>.
            In the first case obviously <m>x \prece x = a</m>,
            and in the second <m>x \prece b \prece a</m> since <m>b</m> is the largest element of <m>A'</m>.
            This shows that <m>a</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in all cases we have shown that <m>A</m> has a largest element,
            which completes the induction.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We again show this by induction on the (finite) cardinality of the set.
            First, if <m>A</m> is a simply ordered set with cardinality 1 then clearly <m>A = \braces{a}</m> for some <m>a</m>,
            which is clearly trivially the same order type as the section <m>\braces{1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that all simply ordered sets of cardinality <m>n</m> have the order type of a section of positive integers.
            Consider then a set <m>A</m> simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> that has cardinality <m>n+1</m>.
            Clearly <m>A \neq \es</m> so that it has a largest element <m>a</m> by part<nbsp/>(a).
            Then the set <m>A' = A - \braces{a}</m> has cardinality <m>n</m> by Lemma<nbsp/>6.1.
            Since <m>A'</m> is also clearly simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>
            (with the appropriate restriction)
            it follows from the induction hypothesis that it has order type of
            <m>\intsfin{m}</m> for some <m>m \in \pints</m>.
            Since this also implies that <m>A'</m> has the cardinality of <m>m</m>,
            it has to be that <m>m=n</m> since this cardinality is unique
            (by Lemma<nbsp/>6.5).
            So let <m>f'</m> be the order-preserving bijection from <m>A'</m> to <m>\intsfin{m} = \intsfin{n}</m>.
            Now define
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x) = \begin{cases}f'(x) \amp  x \neq a \\ n+1 \amp  x = a \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>x \in A</m>.
            It is clear that <m>f</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>\intsfin{n+1}</m> since obviously
            <m>n+1 \in \intsfin{n+1}</m> and the image of <m>f'</m> is <m>\intsfin{n} \ss \intsfin{n+1}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider next any <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> in <m>A</m> where <m>x \prec x'</m>.
            Suppose for the moment that <m>x = a</m>.
            Then <m>x' \prece a = x</m> since <m>a</m> is the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            This contradicts the fact that
            <m>x \prec x'</m> so that it must be that <m>x \neq a</m>.
            Then <m>f(x) = f'(x)</m>.
            If also <m>x' \neq a</m> then clearly
            <m>f(x) = f'(x) \lt f'(x') = f(x')</m> since <m>f'</m> preserves order.
            If <m>x' = a</m> then <m>f(x') = n+1</m> so that
            <m>f(x) = f'(x) \leq n \lt n+1 = f(x')</m> since the image of <m>f'</m> is only <m>\intsfin{n}</m>.
            Hence in all cases <m>f(x) \lt f(x')</m> so that <m>f</m> preserves order since <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> were arbitrary.
            Note that this also shows that <m>f</m> is injective since,
            for any <m>x,x' \in A</m> where <m>x \neq x'</m>,
            we can assume without loss of generality that <m>x \prec x'</m>
            (since it must be that <m>x \prec x'</m> or <m>x' \prec x</m>)
            so that <m>f(x) \lt f(x')</m>,
            and hence <m>f(x) \neq f(x')</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly consider any <m>k \in \intsfin{n+1}</m>.
            If <m>k = n+1</m> then clearly by definition <m>f(a) = n+1 = k</m>,
            noting that obviously <m>a \in A</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>k \neq n+1</m> then it has to be that <m>k \lt n+1</m> so <m>k \leq n</m>.
            Then <m>k \in \intsfin{n}</m>,
            which is the image of <m>f'</m> so that there is an <m>x \in A'</m> where
            <m>f'(x) = k</m> since <m>f'</m> is bijective
            (and therefore surjective).
            Since <m>x \in A'</m> we have that <m>x \in A</m> but
            <m>x \neq a</m> so that <m>f(x) = f'(x) = k</m>.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>k</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we have shown that <m>f</m> is an order-preserving bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>\intsfin{n+1}</m>,
            which completes the induction since by definition <m>A</m> has order type <m>\intsfin{n+1}</m>.

            It also follows from Exercise<nbsp/>5.3 part<nbsp/>(c) that
            <m>A \times B = \es</m> since <m>B</m> is empty.
            Hence clearly <m>A \times B</m> is finite.

        </proof>
        <p>
          If we add the additional stipulation that both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are nonempty,
          then the statement becomes true.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>A \times B</m> is finite there is a bijective function
            <m>f: A \times B \to \intsfin{n}</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            We then show that <m>A</m> is finite by first constructing an injective function <m>g</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>A \times B</m>.
            Since <m>B \neq \es</m>, there is a <m>b \in B</m>.
            So, for any <m>x \in A</m>, set <m>g(x) = (x, b)</m>,
            which is clearly in <m>A \times B</m> so that <m>g</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>A \times B</m>.
            Now consider <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> in <m>A</m> where <m>x \neq x'</m>.
            Then clearly <m>g(x) = (x,b) \neq (x', b) = g(x')</m>.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is injective since <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then have that the composition

            <m>\intsfin{n}</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>2.4 part<nbsp/>(b) since <m>f</m> is injective as well
            (since it is a bijection).
            Therefore <m>A</m> is finite by Corollary<nbsp/>6.7.
            An analogous argument uses the fact that
            <m>A \neq \es</m> to show that <m>B</m> is also finite.

            Hence <m>f</m> is a function from <m>\pset{A}</m> to <m>X^n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective consider <m>Y</m> and <m>Y'</m> in
            <m>\pset{A}</m> where <m>Y \neq Y'</m>.
            Also let <m>\vx = f(Y)</m> and <m>\vx' = f(Y')</m> as defined above.
            Since <m>Y \neq Y'</m>,
            we can without loss of generality assume that there is an <m>i \in Y</m> where <m>i \notin Y'</m>.
            It then follows that <m>x_i = 1 \neq 0 = x_i'</m> by the definition of <m>f</m>.
            Hence clearly <m>f(Y) = \vx = \seqfin{x}{n} \neq \seqfin{x'}{n} = \vx' = f(Y')</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>Y</m> and <m>Y'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vx \in X^n</m> and let <m>Y = \braces{i \in A \where x_i = 1}</m>.
            Clearly <m>Y \ss A</m> so that <m>Y \in \pset{A}</m>.
            Let <m>\vx' = f(Y)</m> and consider any <m>i \in \intsfin{n} = A</m>.
            If <m>i \in Y</m> then <m>x_i = 1 = x_i'</m> by the definitions of <m>Y</m> and <m>f</m>.
            It <m>i \notin Y</m> then <m>x_i \neq 1</m> so that it has to be that <m>x_i = 0</m> since <m>x_i \in X = \braces{0,1}</m>.
            Also, by the definition of <m>f</m>,
            we have that <m>x_i' = 0 = x_i</m>.
            Thus in either case <m>x_i = x_i'</m> so that
            <m>\vx = \vx' = f(Y)</m> since <m>i</m> was arbitrary.
            Since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f</m> is surjective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore <m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>X^n</m> as desired.

            First, if <m>A = \es</m> then clearly <m>\pset{A} = \pset{\es} = \braces{\es}</m> is finite.
            So assume in what follows that <m>A \neq \es</m>.
            Since <m>A</m> is finite and nonempty there is a bijection <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to
            <m>B = \intsfin{n}</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Let <m>X = \braces{0,1}</m> so that by part<nbsp/>(a) there is a bijection <m>g</m> from <m>\pset{B}</m> to <m>X^n</m>.
            For any <m>Y \in \pset{A}</m> clearly the mapping

            It then follows that <m>g \circ h</m> is bijection from <m>\pset{A}</m> to <m>X^n</m>.
            Since clearly <m>X^n</m> is a finite cartesian product of finite sets,
            it follows from Corollary<nbsp/>6.8 that <m>X^n</m> is finite so that

          show that the set of all functions <m>f : A \to B</m> is finite.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            As is customary,
            denote the set of all functions from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> by <m>B^A</m>.
            First, if <m>A = \es</m>,
            then the only function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is the vacuous function <m>\es</m> so that
            <m>B^A = \braces{\es}</m>, which is clearly finite.
            So assume that <m>A \neq \es</m>.
            Then, since <m>A</m> is finite,
            there is a bijection <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to
            <m>\intsfin{n}</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            noting that of course <m>\inv{f}</m> is then a bijection from <m>\intsfin{n}</m> to <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We construct a bijection <m>h</m> from <m>B^A</m> to <m>B^n</m>.
            So, for any <m>g \in B^A</m> set <m>h(g) = g \circ \inv{f}</m>,
            noting that clearly this is a function from <m>\intsfin{n}</m> to <m>B</m>.
            Hence <m>h</m> is a function from <m>B^A</m> to <m>B^n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>h</m> is injective consider <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m> in <m>B^A</m> where <m>g \neq g'</m>.
            It then follows that there is an <m>a \in A</m> where <m>g(a) \neq g'(a)</m>.
            Then let <m>k = f(a)</m> so that clearly
            <m>\inv{f}(k) = a</m> and <m>k \in \intsfin{n}</m>.
            We then have that <m>(g \circ \inv{f})(k) = g(\inv{f}(k)) = g(a) \neq g'(a) = g'(\inv{f}(k)) = (g' \circ \inv{f})(k)</m> so that it must be that <m>h(g) = g \circ \inv{f} \neq g' \circ \inv{f} = h(g')</m>.
            Since <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>h</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any function <m>i \in B^n</m> and let
            <m>g = i \circ f</m> so that clearly <m>g</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> since
            <m>f : A \to \intsfin{n}</m> and <m>i : \intsfin{n} \to B</m>.
            Hence <m>g \in B^A</m>,
            and <m>h(g) = g \circ \inv{f} = (i \circ f) \circ \inv{f} = i \circ (f \circ \inv{f}) = i</m>.
            Since <m>i</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>h</m> is surjective as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence <m>h</m> is bijection from <m>B^A</m> to <m>B^n</m>.
            Now, since <m>B^n</m> is a finite cartesian product of finite sets
            (since <m>B</m> is finite),
            it is finite by Corollary<nbsp/>6.8.
            Thus it must be that <m>B^A</m> is also finite since there is bijection between them.

              The set <m>\zs</m> is countably infinite.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, by Example<nbsp/>7.1, the set of integers <m>\ints</m> is countably infinite so that there is a bijection <m>f</m> from <m>\ints</m> to <m>\pints</m>.
            We construct a bijection <m>g</m> from <m>\zs</m> to <m>\zps</m>.
            For any <m>(a,b) \in \zs</m> define <m>g(a,b) = (f(a),
            f(b))</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>g(a,b) \in \zps</m> since <m>\pints</m> is the range of <m>f</m>.
            Hence <m>g</m> is a function from <m>\zs</m> to <m>\zps</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to show that <m>g</m> is bijective.
            First, consider any <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>(a',b')</m> in <m>\zs</m> where
            <m>(a,b) \neq (a',b')</m> so that <m>a \neq a'</m> or <m>b \neq b'</m>.
            If <m>a \neq a'</m> then <m>f(a) \neq f(a')</m> since <m>f</m> is bijective
            (and therefore injective).
            Thus we have that <m>g(a,b) = (f(a),f(b)) \neq (f(a'),f(b')) = g(a',b')</m>.
            A similar argument shows the same result when <m>b \neq b'</m>.
            Since <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>(a',b')</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>g</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>(c,d) \in \zps</m> so that <m>c,d \in \pints</m>.
            Since <m>f</m> is surjective
            (since it is a bijection)
            there are <m>a,b \in \ints</m> where <m>f(a) = c</m> and <m>f(b) = d</m>.
            We then clearly have that <m>g(a,b) = (f(a),f(b)) = (c,d)</m> so that <m>g</m> is surjective <m>(c,d)</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore <m>g</m> is a bijection.
            Now, we know from Corollary<nbsp/>7.4 that <m>\zps</m> is countably infinite so that there must be a bijection <m>h</m> from <m>\zps</m> to <m>\pints</m>.
            It then follows that <m>h \circ g</m> is bijection from <m>\zs</m> to <m>\pints</m>,
            which shows the desired result by definition.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First we define a straightforward function <m>f</m> from <m>\zs</m> to <m>\rats</m>.
            First consider any <m>(m,n) \in \zs</m>.
            If <m>n \neq 0</m> then let <m>q = m/n</m>.
            If <m>n = 0</m> then set <m>q = 0</m>.
            Setting <m>f(m,n) = q</m> we clearly have that <m>f</m> is a function from <m>\zs</m> to <m>\rats</m>.
            Now consider any rational <m>q</m> so that by definition there are integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> where <m>q=m/n</m>.
            It then of course follows that <m>f(m,n) = m/n = q</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>q</m> was arbitrary.

          <p>
            Now, from <xref ref="lem_countun_zs">Lemma</xref>
            we know that <m>\zs</m> is countably infinite so that there is a bijection <m>g</m> from <m>\zs</m> to <m>\pints</m>.
            Hence <m>\inv{g}</m> is a bijection from <m>\pints</m> to <m>\zs</m>.
            It then follows that the function
            <m>f \circ \inv{g}</m> is a surjective function from <m>\pints</m> to <m>\rats</m>.
            From this it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>7.1 that <m>\rats</m> is countable.
            Since <m>\pints</m> is a subset of <m>\rats</m>,
            it has to be that <m>\rats</m> is infinite,
            and hence must be countably infinite.

        <proof>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective,
            consider <m>n,m \in \ints</m> where <m>n \neq m</m>.

          <p>
            Case: <m>n > 0</m>.
            Then <m>f(n) = 2n</m>, which is clearly even.
            If <m>m > 0</m>, then clearly
            <m>f(n) = 2n \neq 2m = f(m)</m> since <m>n \neq m</m>.
            If <m>m \leq 0</m> then <m>f(m) = -2m + 1 = 2(-m) + 1</m> is clearly odd so that it must be that <m>f(n) \neq f(m)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>n \leq 0</m>.
            Then <m>f(n) = -2n+1 = 2(-n)+1</m>, which is clearly odd.
            If <m>m > 0</m> then <m>f(m) = 2m</m> is even so that it has to be that <m>f(n) \neq f(m)</m>.
            If <m>m \leq 0</m> then <m>f(m) = -2m+1 \neq -2n+1 = f(n)</m> since <m>n \neq m</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in every case <m>f(n) \neq f(m)</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is surjective,
            consider any <m>k \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>k</m> is even then <m>k = 2n</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Hence <m>n > 0</m>
            (since <m>k > 0</m> and <m>n=k/2</m>)
            so that <m>f(n) = 2n = k</m>,
            noting that <m>n \in \ints</m> since <m>\pints \ss \ints</m>.
            If <m>k</m> is odd then <m>k = 2m-1</m> for some <m>m \in \pints</m>.
            So let <m>n=1-m</m> so that clearly <m>n</m> is an integer and

          <p>
            Thus <m>f(n) = -2n+1 = -2(1-m) + 1 = -2 + 2m + 1 = 2m-1 = k</m>.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>k</m> was arbitrary.
            Therefore we have shown that <m>f</m> is a bijection as desired.

          Regarding Example<nbsp/>7.2, the following set is defined:

        <p>
          Then the function <m>f</m> is defined from <m>\zps</m> to <m>A</m> by

            <mrow>f(x,y) = (x+y-1, y)</mrow>
          </md>
          for <m>(x,y) \in \zps</m>.
          It is claimed that <m>f</m> is a bijection.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, it is not even clear that the range of <m>f</m> is constrained to <m>A</m>,
            so let us show this.
            Consider any <m>(x,y) \in \zps</m> so that <m>f(x,y) = (x+y-1, y)</m>.
            Since <m>x \geq 1</m> and <m>y \geq 1</m>,
            we have that <m>x+y \geq 1 + 1 = 2 > 1</m> so that
            <m>x+y-1 > 0</m> and hence <m>x+y-1 \in \pints</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>f(x,y) = (x+y-1,y) \in \zps</m>.
            We also have
            <md>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq x</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \amp \leq x-1</mrow>
              <mrow>y \amp \leq x+y-1 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore it is clear that <m>f(x,y) = (x+y-1,y) \in A</m> by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective consider <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> in <m>\zps</m> where <m>f(x,y) = (x+y-1,y) = (x'+y'-1,y') = f(x',y')</m>.
            Thus <m>x+y-1 = x'+y'-1</m> and <m>y = y'</m>.
            Therefore <m>x+y-1 = x'+y'-1 = x'+y-1</m>,
            from which it obviously follows that <m>x = x'</m> as well.
            Then <m>(x,y) = (x',y')</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>(z,y) \in A</m> so that <m>(z,y) \in \zps</m> and <m>y \leq z</m>.
            Let <m>x = z-y+1</m> so that clearly <m>z = x+y-1</m>.
            We also have
            <md>
              <mrow>y \amp \leq z = x+y-1</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \amp \leq x-1</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq x</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>(x,y) \in \zps</m>.
            Since also we have <m>f(x,y) = (x+y-1,y) = (z,y)</m>,
            <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>(z,y)</m> was arbitrary.
            This completes the proof that <m>f</m> is a bijection.

        <p>
          The function <m>g</m> is then defined from <m>A</m> to <m>\pints</m> by

            <mrow>g(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + y</mrow>
          </md>
          for <m>(x,y) \in A</m>.
          This is also claimed to be a bijection.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that the range of <m>g</m> is indeed <m>\pints</m> since this is not obvious.
            Consider any <m>(x,y) \in A</m> so that <m>(x,y) \in \zps</m> and <m>y \leq x</m>.
            First, if <m>x</m> is even then <m>x = 2n</m> for some <m>n \in \ints</m>.
            Then <m>g(x,y) = (x-1)x/2 + y = (2n-1)(2n)/2 + y = (2n-1)n+y</m>,
            which is clearly an integer.
            If <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x = 2n+1</m> for some integer <m>n</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>g(x,y) = (x-1)x/2+y = (2n+1-1)(2n+1)/2+y = (2n)(2n+1)/2+y = n(2n+1)+y \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is also clearly an integer.
            We also have that <m>-y \lt  0</m> since <m>y > 0</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>x \amp \geq 1</mrow>
              <mrow>x-1 \amp \geq 0</mrow>

              <mrow>g(x,y) \amp > 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we have shown that <m>g(x,y) \in \ints</m> as well,
            it follows that <m>g(x,y) \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>(x,y) \in A</m> so that <m>(x,y) \in \zps</m> and <m>y \leq x</m>.
            Then clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>g(x,y) \amp = \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + y \leq \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + x</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp \lt  \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x+x+1 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - x + 2x) + 1</mrow>

              <mrow>\amp = g(x+1,1) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple inductive argument shows that
            <m>g(x,y) \lt g(x+n,1)</m> for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            This was just shown for <m>n=1</m>.
            Then, assuming it true for <m>n</m>,
            we have that <m>g(x,y) \lt g(x+n,1) \lt g((x+n)+1,1) = g(x+(n+1),1)</m>,
            which completes the induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> in <m>A</m> so that <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> are in <m>\zps</m>,
            <m>y \leq x</m>, and <m>y' \leq x'</m>.
            Also suppose that <m>(x,y) \neq (x',y')</m> so that either <m>x \neq x'</m> or <m>y \neq y</m>.
            If <m>x=x'</m> then it has to be that <m>y \neq y'</m> so that clearly
            <md>
              <mrow>y \amp \neq y'</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + y \amp \neq \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + y'</mrow>
              <mrow>\frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + y \amp \neq \frac{1}{2}(x'-1)x' + y'</mrow>
              <mrow>g(x,y) \amp \neq g(x',y') \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>x \neq x'</m> then we can assume that <m>x \lt  x'</m>.
            Then let <m>n = x'-x</m> so that clearly <m>n > 0</m> and <m>x' = x+n</m>.
            By what was just shown, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>g(x,y) \lt  g(x+n,1) = g(x',1) = \frac{1}{2}(x'-1)x' + 1 \leq \frac{1}{2}(x'-1)x' + y' = g(x',y')</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>1 \leq y'</m>.
            Thus <m>g(x,y) \neq g(x',y')</m>.
            Since this is true in both cases,
            this shows that <m>g</m> is injective since <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> is also surjective,
            consider any <m>z \in \pints</m>.
            Define the set <m>B = \braces{x \in \pints \where g(x,1) \leq z}</m>.
            First, we have that <m>g(1,1) = 1 \leq z</m> since
            <m>z \in \pints</m> so that <m>1 \in B</m> and therefore <m>B \neq \es</m>.
            If <m>z = 1</m> then clearly <m>z = 1 \leq 1 = g(1,1) = g(z,1)</m>.
            If <m>z \neq 1</m> then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>2 \amp \leq z</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq \frac{1}{2}z</mrow>
              <mrow>z-1 \amp \leq \frac{1}{2}(z-1)z</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq \frac{1}{2}(z-1)z + 1</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq g(z,1)</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x,y \in \pints</m> where <m>x \lt y</m>.
            It then follows from what was shown above that <m>g(x,1) \leq g(x,y) \lt g(x+1,1)</m>.
            From this we clearly have that the function <m>g(x,1)</m> is monotonically increasing in <m>x</m>,
            i.e. for <m>x,y \in \pints</m>,
            <m>x \lt y</m> implies that <m>g(x,1) \lt g(y,1)</m>.
            By the contrapositive of this,
            <m>g(x,1) \geq g(y,1)</m> implies that <m>x \geq y</m>.
            With this in mind,
            consider any <m>x \in B</m> so <m>g(x,1) \leq z \leq g(z,1)</m>.
            Then this implies that <m>x \leq z</m>,
            which shows that <m>z</m> is an upper bound of <m>B</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have thus shown that <m>B</m> is a nonempty set of integers that is bounded above.
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>4.9 part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>B</m> has a largest element <m>x</m>.
            Now let <m>y = z - g(x,1) + 1</m>,
            noting that, since <m>x \in B</m>,
            <md>
              <mrow>g(x,1) \amp \leq z</mrow>
              <mrow>0 \amp \leq z - g(x,1)</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq z - g(x,1) + 1</mrow>
              <mrow>1 \amp \leq y</mrow>
            </md>
            and hence <m>y \in \pints</m> so that <m>(x,y) \in \zps</m>.
            We also must have that <m>z \lt  g(x+1,1)</m> since otherwise we would have that <m>x+1 \in B</m>,
            which would violate the definition of <m>x</m> as being the largest element of <m>B</m>.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq g(x+1,1) - 1</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq \frac{1}{2}(x+1-1)(x+1) + 1 - 1</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq \frac{1}{2}(x+1)x</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq x + \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq x + \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + 1 - 1</mrow>
              <mrow>z \amp \leq x + g(x,1) - 1</mrow>
              <mrow>z - g(x,1) + 1 \amp \leq x</mrow>
              <mrow>y \amp \leq x</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>(x,y) \in A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, since <m>y = z - g(x,1) + 1</m>, we clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>z = y + g(x,1) - 1 = y + \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + 1 - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(x-1)x + y = g(x,y) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>z</m> was arbitrary,
            thereby completing the long and arduous proof that <m>g</m> is a bijection.

            Similar to Exercise<nbsp/>6.6 part<nbsp/>(a),
            we construct such a bijection <m>f</m> from <m>\pset{\pints}</m> to <m>X^\w</m>.
            For any <m>A \in \pset{\pints}</m> we have that <m>A \ss \pints</m>.
            Then, for <m>i \in \pints</m>, set
            <md>
              <mrow>x_i = \begin{cases}1 \amp  i \in A \\ 0 \amp  i \notin A \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            and set <m>f(A) = \seqinf{x}</m> so that clearly <m>f(A) \in X^\w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective consider <m>A</m> and <m>A'</m> in
            <m>\pset{\pints}</m> where <m>A \neq A'</m>.
            Without loss of generality,
            we can assume that there is an <m>i \in A</m> where <m>i \notin A'</m>,
            noting that of course <m>i \in \pints</m> since <m>A \ss \pints</m>.
            Let <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} = f(A)</m> and <m>\vx' = \seqinf{x'} = f(A')</m>.
            Then <m>x_i = 1 \neq 0 = x_i'</m> by the definition of <m>f</m> since <m>i \in A</m> but <m>i \notin A'</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>f(A) = \vx \neq \vx' = f(A')</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>A</m> and <m>A'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in X^\w</m> and define the set <m>A = \braces{i \in \pints \where x_i = 1}</m> so that clearly
            <m>A \ss \pints</m> and hence <m>A \in \pset{\pints}</m>.
            Let <m>\vx' = \seqinf{x'} = f(A)</m> and consider <m>i \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>i \in A</m> then <m>x_i' = 1 = x_i</m> by the definitions of <m>A</m> and <m>f</m>.
            If <m>i \notin A</m> then <m>x_i \neq 1</m> since otherwise <m>i \in A</m> by definition.
            Since <m>x_i \in X = \braces{0,1}</m> it clearly must be that <m>x_i = 0</m>.
            We then also have that <m>x_i' = 0</m> by the definition of <m>f</m>,
            and thus <m>x_i = 0 = x_i'</m>.
            Since <m>x_i = x_i'</m> in both cases and <m>i</m> was arbitrary,
            it follows that <m>\vx = \vx' = f(A)</m>.
            This proves that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.

              (It is a somewhat surprising fact that only two transcendental numbers are familiar to us:
              <m>e</m> and <m>\pi</m>.
              Even proving these two numbers transcendental is highly nontrivial.)

        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider arbitrary degree <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Then for each <m>\vq = \seqfin{q}{n} \in \rats^n</m>,
            there is a corresponding polynomial equation in <m>x</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow>x^n + \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i x^{i-1}  = x^n + q_n x^{n-1} + \cdots + q_2 x + q_1 = 0 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is assumed to have a finite number of solutions.
            So let <m>X_\vq</m> be the finite set real numbers that are solutions. (We note that the polynomial corresponding to the vector
            <m>\vq = (0,\ldots,0) \in \rats^n</m> becomes <m>0=0</m> so that any real number <m>x</m> satisfies it.
            Similarly the polynomial corresponding to
            <m>\vq = (q_1, 0, \ldots, 0) \in \rats^n</m> for nonzero <m>q_1</m> corresponds to the equation <m>q_1 = 0</m>,
            which has no solutions.
            Of course <m>X_\vq = \es</m> is still finite in this case.
            For the infinite-solution case we could simply remove the zero vector from <m>\rats^n</m> without changing the argument in any substantial way.
            This is also taken care of if we really do assume that <em>any</em>
            polynomial has a finite number of solutions as we are evidently doing here.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we clearly have that <m>\rats^n</m> is countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.6 since it is a finite product of countable sets
            (since it was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>7.1 that <m>\rats</m> is countable).
            Thus the set <m>A_n = \bigcup_{\vq \in \rats^n} X_\vq</m> is countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.5 since it is a countable union of finite
            (and therefore countable)
            sets.
            Of course, this is the set of all algebraic numbers from polynomials of degree <m>n</m>.
            Then <m>A = \bigcup_{n \in \pints} A_n</m> is the set of all algebraic numbers,
            which is also then countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.5 since each <m>A_n</m> was shown to be countable.

        <proof>
          <p>
            As in part<nbsp/>(a),
            let <m>A \ss \reals</m> be the set of algebraic numbers so that clearly,
            by definition,
            <m>T = \reals - A</m> is the set of transcendental numbers.
            Note that clearly <m>\reals = A \cup T</m> so that,
            if <m>T</m> were countable,
            then <m>\reals</m> would be too since it is a finite union of countable sets.
            This of course contradicts the
            (hitherto unproven)
            fact that <m>\reals</m> is uncountable so that it must be that <m>T</m> is also uncountable as desired.

          We claim that <m>A</m> is countable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For any <m>f \in A</m>, clearly the mapping
            <m>g(f) = (f(0),
            f(1))</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>\pints^2</m>.
            Since <m>\pints^2</m> is a finite cartesian product of countable sets,
            it follows that it is also countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.6.
            Hence there is a bijection <m>h :\pints^2 \to \pints</m>.
            It is then obvious that <m>h \circ g</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>\pints</m> so that <m>A</m> is countable.

          We claim that <m>B_n</m>
          (for some <m>n \in \pints</m>)
          is also countable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            By the definition of <m>\pints^n</m>, <m>B_n = \pints^n</m>,
            which is clearly a finite cartesian product of countable sets.
            Thus <m>B_n</m> is countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.6.

          (c) The set $C = \bigcup_{n \in {\ints_+}} B_n$.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>C</m> is countable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary in part<nbsp/>(b),
            we showed that <m>B_n</m> is countable for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Thus <m>C = \bigcup_{n \in \pints} B_n</m> is a countable union of countable sets,
            which is itself also countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.5 as desired.

          (d) The set $D$ of all functions $f: {\ints_+} \to {\ints_+}$.

        <p>
          Clearly <m>D = \pints^\w</m>,
          which we claim is uncountable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We proceed to show,
            as in Theorem<nbsp/>7.7, that any function <m>g: \pints \to D</m> is not surjective.
            So denote
            <md>
              <mrow>g(n) = \vx_n = (x_{n1}, x_{n2}, \ldots) \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where of course each <m>x_{nm} \in \pints</m> since
            <m>\vx_n \in D</m> and so is a function from <m>\pints</m> to <m>\pints</m>.
            Now set
            <md>
              <mrow>y_n = \begin{cases}0 \amp  x_{nn} \neq 0 \\ 1 \amp  x_{nn} = 0 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            so that clearly <m>\vy = \seqinf{y}</m> is an element of <m>D</m>.
            Now consider any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>x_{nn} = 0</m> then <m>y_n = 1 \neq 0 = x_{nn}</m>,
            and if <m>x_{nn} \neq 0</m> then <m>y_n = 0 \neq x_{nn}</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>g(n) = \vx_n\neq \vy</m> since the <m>n</m>th element of each differs.
            This shows that <m>g</m> cannot be surjective since
            <m>\vy \in D</m> and <m>n</m> was arbitrary.
            It then follows from Theorem<nbsp/>7.1 that <m>D</m> is not countable.

          (e) The set $E$ of all functions $f: {\ints_+} \to \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$.

          This is exactly the set <m>X^\w</m> in Theorem<nbsp/>7.7, wherein it was shown to be uncountable.

          (f) The set $F$ of all functions $f: {\ints_+} \to \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$ that are

          [We say that $f$ is <em><em>eventually zero</em></em>
          if there is a positive integer $N$ such that $f(n) = 0$ for all $n \geq N$.]
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>F</m> is countable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For brevity define <m>X = \braces{0,1}</m>.
            First let <m>F_N</m> be the set of all eventually zero functions
            <m>f:\pints \to X</m> that are zero for <m>n \geq N</m>,
            where of course <m>N \in \pints</m>.
            Then clearly <m>F = \bigcup_{N \in \pints} F_N</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show that each <m>F_N</m> is countable.
            So consider any <m>N \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>N=1</m> then clearly <m>f:\pints \to X</m> defined by <m>f(n)=0</m> for
            <m>n \in \pints</m> (which could be denoted
            <m>(0,0,\ldots)</m>) is the only element of
            <m>F_N = F_1</m> so that <m>f_N</m> is clearly finite and therefore countable.
            If <m>N > 1</m> then for <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{N-1} \in X^{N-1}</m> define
            <md>
              <mrow>y_n = \begin{cases}x_n \amp  n \lt  N \\ 0 \amp  n \geq N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            It then trivial to show that <m>g</m> defined by
            <m>g(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y}</m> is a bijection from <m>X^{N-1}</m> to <m>F_N</m>.
            Now, since <m>X = \braces{0,1}</m> is finite,
            <m>X^{N-1}</m> is finite by Corollary<nbsp/>6.8.
            Since this is in bijective correspondence with <m>F_N</m>,
            it follows that it must also be finite and therefore countable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus <m>F = \bigcup_{N \in \pints} F_N</m> is a countable union of countable sets,
            and so is countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.5 as desired

          Since <m>G</m> is clearly a subset of <m>H</m> in part<nbsp/>(h) below,
          it is countable by Corollary<nbsp/>7.3 since <m>H</m> is.

          We claim that <m>H</m> is countable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            For <m>N \in \pints</m>,
            let <m>H_N</m> be the set of functions
            <m>f: \pints \to \pints</m> such that <m>f(n)</m> is constant for <m>n \geq N</m>.
            Thus clearly <m>H = \bigcup_{N \in \pints} H_N</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show that each <m>H_N</m> is countable.
            So consider <m>N \in \pints</m>.
            For any <m>\vx = \seqfin{x}{N} \in \pints^N</m> define
            <md>
              <mrow>y_n = \begin{cases}x_n \amp  n \lt  N \\ x_N \amp  n \geq N \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for <m>n \in \pints</m>, and set <m>g(\vx) = \vy = \seqinf{y}</m>.
            It is then a simple matter to show that <m>g</m> is a bijection from <m>\pints^N</m> to <m>H_N</m>.
            Then, since <m>\pints^N</m> is a finite product of countable sets,
            it is countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.6.
            Hence <m>H_N</m> must also be countable since there is a bijective correspondence between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus <m>H = \bigcup_{N \in \pints} H_N</m> is the countable union of countable sets so that it must also be countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.5.

          In part<nbsp/>(j) below it is shown that the set <m>J</m> of all finite subsets of <m>\pints</m> is countable.
          Since clearly <m>I \ss J</m>,
          it follows that <m>I</m> is also countable by Corollary<nbsp/>7.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (j) The set $J$ of all finite subsets of ${\ints_+}$.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim that <m>J</m> is countable.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, let <m>J_n</m> denote the set of <m>n</m>-element subsets of <m>\pints</m>
            (for <m>n \in pints</m>),
            and let <m>J_0 = \braces{\es}</m> since <m>\es</m> is the only
            <q>zero-element</q>
            subset of <m>\pints</m>.
            Clearly then <m>J = \bigcup_{n \in \pints \cup \braces{0}} J_n</m>.
            Obviously <m>J_0</m> is finite and therefore countable.
            Next, we show that <m>J_n</m> is countable for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any such <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Clearly <m>\pints^n</m> is countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.6 since it is a finite product of countable sets.
            Hence there is a bijection <m>f : \pints^n \to \pints</m>.
            We now construct an injective function <m>g : J_n \to \pints^n</m>.
            For any <m>X \in J_n</m>,
            we can choose a bijection <m>h : X \to \intsfin{n}</m> since it has <m>n</m> elements.
            Since <m>X \ss \pints</m>,
            clearly <m>\inv{h} \in \pints^n</m>,
            so set <m>g(X) = \inv{h}</m>.
            To show that <m>g</m> is injective,
            consider <m>X</m> and <m>X'</m> in <m>J_n</m> where <m>X \neq X'</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that there is an <m>x \in X</m> where <m>x \notin X'</m>.
            Let <m>h</m> and <m>h'</m> be the chosen bijections from <m>X</m> and <m>X'</m>,
            respectively,
            to <m>\intsfin{n}</m> so that by definition
            <m>g(X) = \inv{h}</m> and <m>g(X') = \inv{h'}</m>.
            Now let <m>k = h(x)</m> so that <m>\inv{h}(k) = x</m>.
            It has to be that <m>\inv{h'}(k) \neq x</m> since otherwise <m>x</m> would be in <m>X'</m>.
            Hence <m>\inv{h}(k) = x \neq \inv{h'}(k)</m>,
            which shows that <m>g(X) = \inv{h} \neq \inv{h'} = g(X')</m>.
            Thus <m>g</m> is injective since <m>X</m> and <m>X'</m> were arbitrary.
            It then follows that <m>f \circ g</m> is an injective function from <m>J_n</m> to <m>\pints</m> so that <m>J_n</m> must be countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>J_n</m> is countable for any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            From this it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>7.5 that
            <m>J = \bigcup_{n \in \pints \cup \braces{0}} J_n</m> is also countable since it is clearly a countable union of countable sets.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Following the hint, we define two sequences of sets recursively:
            <md>
              <mrow>A_1 \amp = A \amp B_1 = B</mrow>
            </md>
            and

              <mrow>A_n \amp = f(A_{n-1}) \amp B_n \amp = f(B_{n-1})</mrow>
            </md>
            for integer <m>n > 1</m>.
            Now define a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = \begin{cases}f(x) \amp  \text{ \(x \in A_n - B_n\) for some \(n \in \pints\) }  \\ x \amp  \text{ otherwise } \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>x \in A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>B</m> really is the range of <m>h</m> as this is not readily apparent.
            So consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            Clearly if <m>x \in A_n - B_n</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m> then
            <m>h(x) = f(x) \in B</m> since <m>B</m> is the range of <m>f</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if this is not the case then <m>x \notin A_n - B_n</m> for any
            <m>n \in \pints</m>, and <m>h(x) = x</m>.
            In particular,
            <m>x \notin A_1 - B_1 = A - B</m> so that it has to be that <m>h(x) = x \in B</m>,
            for otherwise it would be that
            <m>x \in A - B</m> since <m>x \in A</m>.
            Hence, in either case,
            <m>h(x) \in B</m> so that <m>h</m> is indeed a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>h</m> is injective,
            consider any <m>x,x' \in A</m> where <m>x \neq x'</m>.

                    Then we clearly have <m>h(x) = f(x) \neq f(x') = h(x')</m> since <m>f</m> is injective and <m>x \neq x'</m>.
                  </p>

                    Then <m>h(x') = x'</m>.
                    Since <m>x \in A_n</m>, we have that <m>f(x) \in f(A_n) = A_{n+1}</m>.
                    If it were the case that <m>f(x) \in B_{n+1} = f(B_n)</m>,
                    then there would be a <m>y \in B_n</m> such that <m>f(y) = f(x)</m>.
                    Of course, since <m>f</m> is injective,
                    it would have to be that <m>x = y \in B_n</m>,
                    which we know is not the case since <m>x \in A_n - B_n</m>.
                    Hence it has to be that <m>f(x) \notin B_{n+1}</m> so that <m>f(x) \in A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}</m>.
                    From this it is clearly that it cannot be that
                    <m>x' = f(x)</m> so that <m>h(x') = x' \neq f(x) = h(x)</m>.

                      Then clearly <m>h(x) = x \neq x' = h(x')</m>.

          <p>
            Thus in all cases <m>h(x) \neq h(x')</m>,
            which shows that <m>h</m> is injective since <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>h</m> is also surjective,
            consider any <m>y \in B</m>,
            noting that also <m>y \in A</m> since <m>B \ss A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>y \in A_n - B_n</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>n = 1</m> since then <m>y \in A_1 - B_1 = A - B</m>,
            and we know that <m>y \in B</m>.
            Hence <m>n > 1</m> so that <m>n-1 \in \pints</m>.
            Since <m>y \in A_n = f(A_{n-1})</m>,
            there is an <m>x \in A_{n-1}</m> where <m>f(x) = y</m>.
            Suppose for a moment that <m>x \in B_{n-1}</m> so that <m>y = f(x) \in f(B_{n-1}) = B_n</m>,
            which we know not to be the case.
            Thus it must be that <m>x \notin B_{n-1}</m> so that
            <m>x \in A_{n-1} - B_{n-1}</m> and so by definition <m>h(x) = f(x) = y</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>y \notin A_n - B_n</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Then clearly <m>h(y) = y</m> by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>h</m> is surjective since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore it has been shown that <m>h</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>,
            which shows that they have the same cardinality by definition.

          <p>
            Clearly <m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>f(A)</m> since <m>f</m> is injective.
            Also, clearly the function
            <m>g \circ f</m> is an injective function from <m>C</m> into <m>f(A)</m> since both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are injective.
            Noting that obviously <m>f(A) \ss C</m>,
            it then follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>C</m> and <m>f(A)</m> have the same cardinality so that there is a bijection <m>h:
            f(A) \to C</m>.
            We then have that <m>h \circ f</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>C</m> so that they have the same cardinality by definition.

          We show that these have the same cardinality.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>f \in E = X^\pints</m>.
            Then define <m>g(n) = f(n)+1</m> for
            <m>n \in \pints</m> so that clearly <m>g \in \pints^\pints = D</m>.
            Now define the function <m>h : E \to D</m> by <m>h(f) = g</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that <m>h</m> is an injection.

            Clearly then <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in X^\pints</m>,

            <m>X^\pints</m> Also clearly the identity function on <m>\pints</m> is an injection since it is a bijection.
            It then follows from <xref ref="lem_countun_expin">Lemma</xref>
            that there is an injection <m>f_1 : \pints^\pints \to (X^\pints)^\pints</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>X^\pints \neq \es</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We presently have that there is a bijection
            <m>f_2 : (X^\pints)^\pints \to X^{\zps}</m> by <xref ref="lem_countun_expmul">Lemma</xref>,
            which is of course also an injection.
            Finally, since <m>\zps</m> has the same cardinality as <m>\pints</m>
            (by Corollary<nbsp/>7.4),
            it follows that there is an injection from <m>\zps</m> to <m>\pints</m>.
            Since also the identity function on <m>X</m> is an injection,
            we have again that there is an injection
            <m>f_3 : X^{\zps} \to X^\pints</m> by <xref ref="lem_countun_expin">Lemma</xref>.
            Thus clearly then <m>f_3 \circ f_2 \circ f_1</m> is an injection from
            <m>\pints^\pints = D</m> to <m>X^\pints = E</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, since there is an injection from <m>E</m> to <m>D</m> as well as from <m>D</m> to <m>E</m>,
            it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>7.6 part<nbsp/>(b) that <m>D</m> and <m>E</m> have the same cardinality as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First, for <m>\vx \in X^\w</m>,
            clearly the function that maps <m>\vx</m> to the set
            <m>\braces{\vx}</m> is an injective function from <m>X^\w</m> to <m>\css</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we construct an injection <m>f_1 : \css \to (X^\w)^\w</m>.
            So consider any <m>S \in \css</m> so that <m>S</m> is a countable subset of <m>X^\w</m>.
            Then, by Theorem<nbsp/>7.1, we can choose a surjective function <m>g : \pints \to S</m>.
            Note that this does require the Axiom of Choice since we must choose such a surjection for each <m>S \in \css</m>,
            and clearly <m>\css</m> is infinite.
            Since <m>S \ss X^\w</m>,
            <m>g</m> can be considered as a function from <m>\pints</m> to <m>X^\w</m> so that <m>g \in (X^\w)^\w</m>,
            though of course it would no longer necessarily be surjective with this range.
            So we simply set <m>f_1(S) = g</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f_1</m> is injective consider
            <m>S,S' \in \css</m> where <m>S \neq S'</m>.
            Then, setting <m>g = f_1(S)</m> and <m>g' = f_1(S')</m>,
            we have that <m>g(\pints) = S</m> and <m>g'(\pints) = S'</m> by definition.
            Since <m>S \neq S'</m>,
            we have that <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m> have the same domain but different image sets.
            Clearly this means that <m>f_1(S) = g \neq g' = f_1(S')</m>,
            which shows that <m>f_1</m> is injective since <m>S</m> and <m>S'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence <m>f_1</m> is an injection from <m>\css</m> to <m>(X^\w)^\w = (X^\pints)^\pints</m>.
            Now, from <xref ref="lem_countun_expmul">Lemma</xref>,
            we have that <m>(X^\pints)^\pints</m> has the same cardinality as
            <m>X^{\zps}</m> so that there is a bijection <m>f_2 : (X^\pints)^\pints \to X^{\zps}</m>,
            which is of course also an injection.
            Finally, since <m>\zps</m> has the same cardinality as <m>\pints</m>
            (by Corollary<nbsp/>7.4),
            it follows that there is an injection from <m>\zps</m> to <m>\pints</m>.
            Since also the identity function on <m>X</m> is an injection,
            we have that there is an injection
            <m>f_3 : X^{\zps} \to X^\pints</m> by <xref ref="lem_countun_expin">Lemma</xref>.
            Then clearly <m>f_3 \circ f_2 \circ f_1</m> is an injection from <m>\css</m> to <m>X^\pints = X^\w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there is an injection from <m>X^\w</m> to <m>\css</m> and vice-versa,
            it follows that they have the same cardinality by Exercise<nbsp/>7.6 part<nbsp/>(b) as desired.

        <p>
          (a) First, notice that <m>(*)</m> does not satisfy the principle of recursive definition because,
          for <m>n \geq 2</m>,
          <m>h(n)</m> is not defined strictly in terms of values of <m>h</m> for positive integers less than <m>n</m>,
          since its definition depends on <m>h(n+1)</m>.
          Now we show that there does exists a function satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider the following reformulation:
            <md>
              <mrow>h(1) \amp = 1\,,</mrow>
              <mrow>h(2) \amp = 2\,,</mrow>
              <mrow>h(n) \amp = \sqrt{h(n-1) + [h(n-2)]^2} \condgap \text{ for \(n > 2\) } \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where as is convention we take the positive square root for <m>h(n)</m>.
            Clearly for <m>n \in \braces{1,2}</m> we have that <m>h(n)</m> is positive.
            Now suppose <m>n > 2</m> and that <m>h(k)</m> is positive for
            <m>k \lt  n</m> so that <m>h(n-1)</m> and <m>h(n-2)</m> are both positive.
            Then clearly <m>h(n-1) + [h(n-2)]^2</m> is positive so that
            <m>h(n) = \sqrt{h(n-1) + [h(n-2)]^2}</m> is defined and is positive.
            Hence <m>h(n)</m> is positive and well-defined for all <m>n \in \pints</m> by induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, since <m>h(n)</m> depends only on values of <m>h</m> for integers less than <m>n</m>,
            this satisfies the recursion principle so that a unique <m>h</m> satisfying the above exists.
            We also claim that this <m>h</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Clearly the explicitly defined values of <m>h(1)</m> and <m>h(2)</m> are satisfied.
            For <m>n \geq 2</m>,
            we have that <m>n+1 > 2</m> so that, by definition,
            <md>
              <mrow>h(n+1) = \sqrt{h((n+1)-1) + [h((n+1)-2)]^2} = \sqrt{h(n) + [h(n-1)]^2}</mrow>
              <mrow>[h(n+1)]^2 = h(n) + [h(n-1)]^2</mrow>
              <mrow>h(n) = [h(n+1)]^2 - [h(n-1)]^2 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is the final constraint of <m>(*)</m> so that it is also satisfied since <m>n \geq 2</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b) First note that,
          for the recursively defined function <m>h</m> from part<nbsp/>(a),
          <md>
            <mrow>h(3) \amp = \sqrt{h(2) + [h(1)]^2} = \sqrt{2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{3}</mrow>
            <mrow>h(4) \amp = \sqrt{h(3) + [h(2)]^2} = \sqrt{\sqrt{3} + 2^2} = \sqrt{\sqrt{3} + 4} \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now define the function <m>f</m> as in the hint,
          that is <m>f(i) = h(i)</m> for
          <m>i \neq 3</m> and <m>f(3) = -h(3)</m>.
          Then we clearly have <m>f(3) = -h(3) = -\sqrt{3}</m> while
          <md>
            <mrow>^2 - [f(2)]^2 = [h(4)]^2 - [h(2)]^2 = \parens{\sqrt{\sqrt{3} + 4}}^2 - 2^2 = \sqrt{3} + 4 - 4 = \sqrt{3}</mrow>
          </md>
          so that <m>f(n) = -\sqrt{3} \neq \sqrt{3} = [f(n+1)]^2 - [f(n-1)]^2</m> for <m>n = 3</m>,
          and hence <m>(*)</m> is violated.
          So it would seem that the hint as given does not exactly work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we show that the function satisfying <m>(*)</m> is not unique,
          taking inspiration from the hint.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We construct a function <m>f</m>,
            different from <m>h</m> from part<nbsp/>(a),
            that also satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            We define <m>f</m> using recursion:
            <md>
              <mrow>f(1) \amp = 1\,,</mrow>
              <mrow>f(2) \amp = 2\,,</mrow>
              <mrow>f(3) \amp = -\sqrt{3}\,,</mrow>
              <mrow>f(n) \amp = \sqrt{f(n-1) + [f(n-2)]^2} \condgap \text{ for \(n > 3\) } \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, since each <m>f(n)</m> is defined only in terms of <m>f(k)</m> for <m>k \lt n</m>
            (or without dependence on any values of <m>f</m>),
            <m>f</m> exists uniquely by the recursion principle so long as each <m>f(n)</m> is well-defined.
            We show this presently by induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly <m>f(n)</m> is defined for <m>n \in \braces{1,2,3}</m>.
            For <m>n=4</m> we have <m>f(n) = f(4) = \sqrt{f(3) + [f(2)]^2} = \sqrt{-\sqrt{3} + 2^2} \sqrt{-\sqrt{3} + 4}</m>.
            Now, since <m>1 \lt 3</m>,
            we have that <m>\sqrt{3} \lt 3 \lt 4</m> so that
            <m>-\sqrt{3} + 4 = 4 - \sqrt{3} > 0</m> and hence the square root,
            and therefore <m>f(4)</m>, is defined and positive.
            Now consider any <m>n > 4</m> and suppose that <m>f(n-1)</m> is positive.
            Then clearly <m>f(n) = \sqrt{f(n-1) + [f(n-2)]^2}</m> is defined and positive since <m>f(n-1) > 0</m>,
            noting that even if <m>f(n-2) \leq 0</m>,
            its square is non-negative.. This completes the induction that shows that <m>f</m> is uniquely defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly <m>f \neq h</m> since <m>f(3) = -\sqrt{3} \neq \sqrt{3} = h(3)</m>.
            Also obviously <m>f(n)</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m> explicitly for <m>n \in \braces{1,2}</m>.
            For <m>n = 2</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>^2 - [f(n-1)]^2 = [f(3)]^2 - [f(1)]^2 = [-\sqrt{3}]^2 - 1^2 = 3-1 = 2 = f(n) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, for <m>n > 2</m> we have <m>n+1 > 3</m> so that,
            by definition,
            <md>
              <mrow>f(n+1) = \sqrt{f((n+1)-1) + [f((n+1)-2)]^2} = \sqrt{f(n) + [f(n-1)]^2}</mrow>

              <mrow>f(n) = [f(n+1)]^2 - [f(n-1)]^2 \,</mrow>

            Thus the recursive part of <m>(*)</m> holds for

          <p>
            Suppose that such a function <m>h</m> does exist.
            Since the recursive property holds for <m>n \geq 2</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(2) = [h(3)]^2 + [h(1)]^2</mrow>
              <mrow>2 = [h(3)]^2 + 1^2</mrow>
              <mrow>[h(3)]^2 = 2 - 1^2 = 1</mrow>
              <mrow>h(3) = \pm 1 \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(3) = [h(4)]^2 + [h(2)]^2</mrow>
              <mrow>\pm 1 = [h(4)]^2 + 2^2</mrow>
              <mrow>[h(4)]^2 = \pm 1 - 2^2 = \pm 1 - 4</mrow>
            </md>
            so that either <m>[h(4)]^2 = 1 - 4  = -3</m> or <m>[h(4)]^2 = -1-4 = -5</m>.
            In either case we have <m>[h(4)]^2 \lt  0</m>,
            which is of course impossible since the square of a real number is always non-negative!
            So it must be that such a function does not exist.

            Consider any <m>m \in \pints</m> and any function <m>f: \intsfin{m} \to \preals</m>.
            Since <m>f(m) \in \preals</m>,
            it follows that <m>f(m) + 1 \in \preals</m> also so that

            Hence <m>\r</m> is a well-defined function with range <m>\preals</m> since <m>m</m> and <m>f</m> were arbitrary.
            It then follows from the principle of recursive definition (Theorem<nbsp/>8.4) that there is a unique function <m>h : \pints \to \preals</m> such that

            Now we show that such a function is unique.
            Suppose that <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> both satisfy the inductive formula.
            We show by induction that <m>g(i) = h(i)</m> for all <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            from which it clearly follows that <m>g = h</m>.
            First, we clearly have <m>g(1) = 3 = h(1)</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>g(i) = h(i)</m> for <m>i \in \pints</m>.

            Suppose to the contrary that there is such a function <m>h</m>.
            Then clearly <m>h(1) = 3</m> and <m>h(2) = \sqrt{h(1) - 1} = \sqrt{3-1} = \sqrt{2}</m>.
            Now, since <m>1 \lt  2 \lt  4</m>,
            we clearly have <m>1 \lt  \sqrt{2} \lt  \sqrt{4} = 2</m>.
            Thus <m>0 \lt  \sqrt{2} - 1 \lt  1</m> so that <m>h(3) = \sqrt{h(2) - 1} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2} - 1}</m> is defined.
            However, we also have that
            <m>0 \lt  h(3) = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}-1} \lt  1</m> since <m>0 \lt  \sqrt{2} -1  \lt  1</m>,
            and hence <m>h(3) - 1 \lt  0</m>.
            We then have that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(4) = \sqrt{h(3) - 1}</mrow>
              <mrow>[h(4)]^2 = h(3) - 1 \lt  0 \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which is of course impossible since a square is always non-negative.
            This contradiction shows that such a function <m>h</m> cannot exist.

        </proof>
        <p>
          Note that this does not ostensibly violate the principle of recursive definition since <m>h(n)</m> is defined only in terms of values of <m>h</m> less than <m>n</m> for <m>n>1</m>.
          However, were one to try to show the existence of <m>h</m> rigorously using the principle,

            If <m>f(m) > 1</m> then clearly <m>f(m) - 1 > 0</m> so that
            <m>\r(f) = [f(m)-1]^{1/2}</m> is defined and positive.
            If <m>f(m) \leq 1</m> then clearly
            <m>\r(f) = 5</m> is also defined and positive.
            Since <m>m</m> and <m>f</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\r</m> is a well-defined function with range <m>\preals</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It then follows from the principle of recursive definition (Theorem<nbsp/>8.4) that there is a unique function <m>h: \pints \to \preals</m> such that

            To see that this <m>h</m> satisfies the recursion formula,

            First, obviously <m>g(1) = 3 = h(1)</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>g(n) = h(n)</m> for
            <m>n \in \pints</m> so that <m>n+1 > 1</m>.
            Then, if <m>g(n) = h(n) > 1</m> then we have <m>g(n+1) = [g(n)-1]^{1/2} = [h(n)-1]^{1/2} = h(n+1)</m> since
            <m>g(n) = h(n)</m> and the roots are taken to be positive.
            Similarly, if <m>g(n) = h(n) \leq 1</m>,
            then <m>g(n+1) = 5 = h(n+1)</m>.
            Thus in either case <m>g(n+1) = h(n+1)</m>,

          Similar to that approach, two lemmas will be proved first.
          In what follows,
          <m>(*)</m> refers to the properties defined in the statement of Theorem<nbsp/>8.4.

        <lemma xml:id="lem_recdef_exists">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Given <m>n \in \pints</m>,
              there exists a function <m>f: \intsfin{n} \to A</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m> for all <m>i</m> in its domain.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this by induction on <m>n</m>.
            First, for <m>n=1</m>,
            clearly the function <m>f: \braces{1} \to A</m> defined by
            <m>f(1) = a_0</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>(*)</m> holds for some function
            <m>f' : \intsfin{n} \to A</m> for <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            Now define <m>f: \intsfin{n+1} \to A</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>f(i) = \begin{cases}f'(i) \amp  i \in \intsfin{n}  \\ \r(f') \amp  i = n+1 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>i \in \intsfin{n+1}</m>.
            Note that <m>f</m> is not defined in terms of itself,
            but in terms of <m>f'</m> and <m>\r</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we clearly have <m>f' = f \rest \intsfin{n}</m> since
            <m>f(i) = f'(i)</m> for all <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>.
            Then, clearly <m>f(1) = f'(1) = a_0</m> since
            <m>1 \leq n</m> and <m>f'</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Consider any <m>i \in \intsfin{n+1}</m> where <m>i > 1</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>f(i) = f'(i) = \r(f' \rest \intsfin{i-1}) = \r(f \rest \intsfin{i-1})</mrow>
            </md>
            if <m>1 \lt  i \leq n</m> since <m>f'</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Lastly, if <m>i = n+1</m>, then
            <md>
              <mrow>f(i) = \r(f') = \r(f \rest \intsfin{n}) = \r(f \rest \intsfin{i-1})</mrow>
            </md>
            again.
            This shows that <m>f</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>,
            thereby completing the induction.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <lemma xml:id="lem_recdef_unique">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>f : \intsfin{n} \to A</m> and
              <m>g : \intsfin{m} \to C</m> both satisfy <m>(*)</m> for all <m>i</m> in their respective domains.
              Then <m>f(i) = g(i)</m> for all <m>i</m> in both domains.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that this is not the case and let <m>i</m> be the
            <em>smallest</em> integer
            (in the domain of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>)
            for which <m>f(i) \neq g(i)</m>.
            Hence <m>f(j) = g(j)</m> for all
            <m>1 \leq j \lt  i</m> so that clearly <m>f \rest \intsfin{i-1} = g \rest \intsfin{i-1}</m>.
            Now, it cannot be that <m>i = 1</m> since clearly <m>f(1) = a_0 = g(1)</m>.
            So then it must be that <m>1 \lt  i</m> so that <m>f(i) = \r(f \rest \intsfin{i-1})</m> and
            <m>g(i) = \r(g \rest \intsfin{i-1})</m> since they both satisfy <m>(*)</m>.
            Since <m>f \rest \intsfin{i-1} = g \rest \intsfin{i-1}</m>,
            we then clearly have
            <md>
              <mrow>f(i) = \r(f \rest \intsfin{i-1}) = \r(g \rest \intsfin{i-1}) = g(i)</mrow>
            </md>
            in contradiction with the definition of <m>i</m>.
            Thus the result must be true as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            <xref ref="lem_recdef_exists">Lemmas</xref>
            and <xref ref="lem_recdef_unique"></xref>
            show that there exists a unique function
            <m>f_n : \intsfin{n} \to A</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m> for every <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            We then define <m>h = \bigcup_{n \in \pints} f_n</m> and claim that this is the unique function from <m>\pints</m> to <m>A</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we must show that <m>h</m> is a function at all.
            So consider any <m>i \in \pints</m> and suppose that <m>(i,x)</m> and <m>(i,y)</m> are in <m>h</m>.
            Then there are <m>n,m \in \pints</m> where <m>(i,x) \in f_n</m> and
            <m>(i,y) \in f_m</m> since <m>h = \bigcup_{n \in \pints} f_n</m>,
            noting that it must be that <m>i \leq n</m> and <m>i \leq m</m>.
            Since <m>f_n</m> and <m>f_m</m> both satisfy <m>(*)</m> and clearly <m>i</m> is in the domain of both,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_recdef_unique">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>x = f_n(i) = f_m(i) = y</m>.
            This shows that <m>h</m> is a function since <m>(i,x)</m> and <m>(i,y)</m> were arbitrary.
            Also, clearly the domain of <m>h</m> is <m>\pints</m> since,
            for any <m>i \in \pints</m>,
            <m>i</m> is in the domain of <m>f_i</m> and so in the domain of <m>h</m>.
            Lastly, clearly the range of <m>h</m> is <m>A</m> since that is the range of all the <m>f_n</m> functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>h</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            First we have that <m>1</m> is clearly in the domain of <m>h</m> and <m>f_1</m> so that it has to be that
            <m>h(1) = f_1(1) = a_0</m> since <m>h</m> is a function,
            <m>f_1 \ss h</m>, and <m>f_1</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>i > 1</m>.
            Then clearly <m>i</m> is in the domain of <m>h</m> and <m>f_i</m> so that it has to be that <m>h(j) = f_i(j)</m> for
            <m>1 \leq j \leq i</m> since <m>h</m> was shown to be a function and <m>f_i \ss h</m>.
            It then follows that <m>h \rest \intsfin{i-1} = f_i \rest \intsfin{i-1}</m>.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(i) = f_i(i) = \r(f_i \rest \intsfin{i-1}) = \r(h \rest \intsfin{i-1})</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>f_i</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            This completes the proof that <m>h</m> also satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, we show that <m>h</m> is unique,
            which is very similar to the proof of <xref ref="lem_recdef_unique">Lemma</xref>.
            So suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are two functions from <m>\pints</m> to <m>A</m> that both satisfy <m>(*)</m>.
            Suppose also that <m>f \neq g</m> so that there is a smallest integer <m>i</m> such that <m>f(i) \neq g(i)</m>.
            Now, it cannot be that <m>i = 1</m> since we have
            <m>f(1) = a_0 = g(1)</m> since they both satisfy <m>(*)</m>.
            Hence <m>i > 1</m> and,
            since <m>i</m> is the smallest integer where <m>f(i) \neq g(i)</m>,
            it follows that <m>f(j) = g(j)</m> for all <m>1 \leq j \lt  i</m>.
            Therefore we have that <m>f \rest \intsfin{i-1} = g \rest \intsfin{i-1}</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>f(i) = \r(f \rest \intsfin{i-1}) = \r(g \rest \intsfin{i-1}) = g(i)</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> both satisfy <m>(*)</m> and <m>i > 1</m>.
            This of course contradicts the definition of <m>i</m> so that it has to be that in fact <m>f=g</m>.
            This shows the uniqueness of <m>h</m> constructed above.

          Verify the following version of the principle of recursive definition: Let <m>A</m> be a set.
          Let <m>\r</m> be a function assigning,

          an element <m>\r(f)</m> of <m>A</m>.
          Then there is a unique function <m>h: \pints \to A</m> such that
          <m>h(n) = \r(h \rest S_n)</m> for each <m>n \in \pints</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Denote the above property of <m>h</m> by <m>(*)</m>.
          We show that there is a unique
          <m>h: \pints \to A</m> satisfying this using the standard principle of recursive definition, Theorem<nbsp/>8.4.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, note that <m>S_1 = \braces{n \in \pints \where n \lt  1} = \es</m> by definition.
            Note also that <m>\es</m> itself is vacuously a function from <m>S_1 = \es</m> to <m>A</m>,
            and is the only such function.
            It then follows that <m>f \rest S_1 = f \rest \es = \es</m> for any
            <m>f : S_n \to A</m> for some <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            So then, define <m>a_0 = \r(\es)</m> so that there is a unique function <m>h</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(1) \amp = a_0 \,,</mrow>
              <mrow>h(i) \amp = \r(h \rest \intsfin{i-1}) \condgap \text{ for \(i > 1\). }</mrow>
            </md>
            by Theorem<nbsp/>8.4.
            Denote this property by <m>(+)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We first claim that this <m>h</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            To see this, consider any <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>n=1</m> then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(n) =  h(1) = a_0 = \r(\es) = \r(h \rest \es) = \r(h \rest S_1) = \r(h \rest S_n) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>n > 1</m> then by <m>(+)</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(n) = \r(h \rest \intsfin{n-1}) = \r(h \rest S_n)</mrow>
            </md>
            again.
            Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>(*)</m> is satisfied.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that this <m>h</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m> is unique,
            suppose that another function
            <m>f: \pints \to A</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(1) = \r(h \rest S_1) = \r(h \rest \es) = \r(\es) = a_0</mrow>

            </md>
            for <m>i > 1</m>.
            This shows that <m>f</m> also satisfies <m>(+)</m>, and,
            since we know that the function satisfying <m>(+)</m> is unique,
            it must be that <m>f = h</m> as desired.

          (c) Since <m>\rats</m> is countable

        <p>
          (d) First, there is an injective function <m>f</m> from the real interval <m>[0,1]</m> to <m>X^\w</m>.
          The most straightforward such function is,
          for each <m>x \in [0,1]</m> let
          <m>0.x_1 x_2 x_3 \ldots</m> be a unique binary expansion of <m>x</m>
          (these can be made unique by avoiding binary expansions that end in all 1's, noting though that the expansion of <m>1</m> itself must be <m>0.111\ldots</m>).
          So suppose that <m>c</m> were a choice function on <m>\col{D}</m>
          (that is presumably constructed without the choice axiom).
          If <m>X</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>[0,1]</m> then <m>f(X)</m> is a set in <m>\col{D}</m> so that we can choose <m>c(f(X)) \in f(X)</m>.
          Since <m>f</m> is injective,
          there is a unique <m>x \in X</m> where <m>f(x) = c(f(X))</m>,
          and so choosing <m>x</m> results in a choice function on the collection of nonempty subsets of <m>[0,1]</m> since <m>X</m> was arbitrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would allow one to then well-order <m>[0,1]</m> without using the choice axiom,
          which evidently nobody has done.
          As far as I have been able to determine,
          this has not yet been proven impossible,
          it is just that nobody has been able to do it.
          So it would seem that such an explicit construction of a choice function on <m>\col{D}</m> would at least make one famous.
          Or else it is impossible, which is what we assume to be the case here.

          Can you define an injective function

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We defer the proof that <m>A</m> is infinite until we define an injective <m>f : \pints \to A</m>,
          which we can do without using the choice axiom by using the principle of recursive definition.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, let <m>a_0 = f_1(1) \in A</m>.
            Now consider any function <m>g : S_n \to A</m>.
            If <m>g = \es</m> then set <m>\r(\es) = \r(g) = a_0</m>.
            Otherwise let <m>I_g = \braces{i \in S_{n+1} \where f_n(i) \notin g(S_n)}</m>.
            Suppose for the moment that <m>I_g = \es</m>.
            Consider any <m>x \in f_n(S_{n+1})</m> so that there is a
            <m>k \in S_{n+1}</m> where <m>f_n(k) = x</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>x = f_n(k) \in g(S_n)</m> since otherwise we would have <m>k \in I_g</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>f_n(S_{n+1}) \ss g(S_n)</m>.
            Thus the identity function <m>h_1 : f_n(S_{n+1}) \to g(S_n)</m> is an injection.
            Clearly <m>g</m> is a surjection from <m>S_n</m> to its image <m>g(S_n)</m> so that there is we can construct a particular injection
            <m>h_2 : g(S_n) \to S_n</m> by Corollary<nbsp/>6.7.
            Lastly, <m>f_n</m> is an injection from <m>S_{n+1}</m> to <m>f_n(S_{n+1})</m>.
            Therefore <m>h = h_2 \circ h_1 \circ f_n</m> is an injection from <m>S_{n+1}</m> to <m>S_n</m>.
            Hence <m>h</m> is a bijection from <m>S_{n+1}</m> to <m>h(S_{n+1})</m>,
            which is clearly a subset of <m>S_n</m> since <m>S_n</m> is the range of <m>h</m>.
            But, since <m>S_n \pss S_{n+1}</m>,
            clearly <m>h(S_{n+1}) \pss S_{n+1}</m> as well so that <m>h</m> is a bijection from <m>S_{n+1}</m> onto a proper subset of itself.
            As <m>S_{n+1}</m> is clearly finite,
            this violates Corollary<nbsp/>6.3 so that we have a contradiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it must be that <m>I_g \neq \es</m> so that it is a nonempty set of positive integers,
            and hence has a smallest element <m>i</m>.
            So simply set <m>\r(g) = f_n(i)</m>.
            Now, it then follows from the principle of recursive definition that there is a unique <m>f: \pints \to A</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>f(1) \amp = a_0 \,,</mrow>
              <mrow>f(n) \amp = \r(f \rest S_n) \condgap \text{ for \(n > 1\). }</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We claim that this <m>f</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see this we first show that
            <m>f(n) \notin f(S_n)</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>.
            If <m>n = 1</m> we have that <m>f(n) = f(1) = a_0 = f_1(1)</m> and
            <m>f(S_n) = f(\es) = \es</m> so that clearly the result holds.
            If <m>n > 1</m> then <m>f(n) = \r(f \rest S_n) = f_n(i)</m> for some <m>i \in I_{f \rest S_n}</m> since clearly
            <m>S_n \neq \es</m> so that <m>f \rest S_n \neq \es</m>.
            Since <m>i \in I_{f \rest S_n}</m> we have that <m>f(n) = f_n(i) \notin (f \rest S_n)(S_n) = f(S_n)</m> as desired.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is injective.
            For consider any <m>n,m \in \pints</m> where <m>n \neq m</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that <m>n \lt m</m>.
            Then clearly <m>f(n) \in f(S_m)</m> since
            <m>n \in S_m</m> since <m>n \lt m</m>.
            However, by what was just shown,
            we have <m>f(m) \notin f(S_m)</m> so that it has to be that <m>f(n) \neq f(m)</m>.
            This shows <m>f</m> to be injective since <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, since <m>f: \pints \to A</m> is injective,
            it follows that <m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>\pints</m> to <m>f(\pints) \ss A</m>.
            Hence <m>f(\pints)</m> is infinite since <m>\pints</m> is,
            and since it is a subset of <m>A</m>,
            it has to be that <m>A</m> is infinite as well.

          This was the proof of Theorem<nbsp/>7.5, which asserts that a countable union of countable sets is also countable.
          The following rewritten proof makes explicit use of the choice axiom and so points out where it is needed.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\braces{A_n}_{n \in J}</m> be an indexed family of countable sets,
            where the index set <m>J</m> is <m>\intsfin{N}</m> or <m>\pints</m>.
            Assume that each set <m>A_n</m> is nonempty for convenience since this does not change anything.
            Now, for each <m>n \in J</m>,
            let <m>B_n</m> be the set of surjective functions from <m>\pints</m> to <m>A_n</m>.
            Since each <m>A_n</m> is countable,
            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>7.1 that <m>B_n \neq \es</m>.
            Then, by the axiom of choice,
            the collection <m>\braces{B_n}_{n \in J}</m> has a choice function <m>c</m> such that
            <m>c(B_n) \in B_n</m> for every <m>n \in J</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now set <m>f_n = c(B_n)</m> for every <m>n \in J</m> so that
            <m>f_n \in B_n</m> and hence is a surjection from <m>\pints</m> into <m>A_n</m>.
            Since <m>J</m> is countable,
            there is also a surjection
            <m>g : \pints \to J</m> by Theorem<nbsp/>7.1.
            Then define <m>h : \pints \times \pints \to \bigcup_{n \in J} A_n</m> by
            <m>h(k,m) = f_{g(k)}(m)</m> for <m>k,m \in \pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We now show that <m>h</m> is surjective.
            So consider any <m>a \in \bigcup_{n \in J} A_n</m> so that
            <m>a \in A_n</m> for some <m>n \in J</m>.
            Since <m>g : \pints \to J</m> is surjective,
            there is a <m>k \in \pints</m> where <m>g(k) = n</m>.
            Also, since <m>f_n : \pints \to A_n</m> is surjective,
            there is an <m>m \in \pints</m> where <m>f_n(m) = a</m>.
            We then have by definition that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(k,m) = f_{g(k)}(m) = f_n(m) = a \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>h</m> is surjective since <m>a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, since <m>\pints \times \pints</m> is countable by Example<nbsp/>7.2, there is a bijection <m>h' : \pints \to \pints \times \pints</m>.
            It then follows that <m>h \circ h'</m> is a surjection from <m>\pints</m> to <m>\bigcup_{n \in J} A_n</m>,
            which shows that <m>\bigcup_{n \in J} A_n</m> is countable again by Theorem<nbsp/>7.1.

          <p>
            Suppose that <m>f: A \to B</m> is surjective.
            Now, by the choice axiom,
            the collection <m>\col{A} = \pset{A} - \braces{\es}</m> is a collection of nonempty sets and thus has a choice function <m>c</m>.
            Consider any <m>b \in B</m> and the set <m>A_b = \braces{x \in A \where f(x) = b}</m>.
            Then <m>A_b \neq \es</m> since <m>f</m> is surjective,
            and hence <m>A_b \in \col{A}</m> since clearly also
            <m>A_b \ss A</m> so that <m>A_b \in \pset{A}</m>.
            So set <m>h(b) = c(A_b) \in A_b</m> so that
            <m>h(b) \in A</m> since <m>A_b \ss A</m>.
            Hence <m>h</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recall that, by definition,
            <m>h</m> is a right inverse if and only if
            <m>f \circ h = i_B</m>, which we show presently.
            So consider any <m>b \in B</m> and let
            <m>a = h(b) = c(A_b) \in A_b</m> so that <m>f(a) = b</m>.
            Then clearly

              <mrow>(f \circ h)(b) = f(h(b)) = f(a) = b \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which shows that <m>f \circ h = i_B</m> since <m>b</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence <m>h</m> is a right inverse of <m>f</m>.

            Suppose that <m>f : A \to B</m> is injective and <m>A \neq \es</m>.
            Then <m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to its image
            <m>f(A) \ss B</m> and hence its inverse <m>\inv{f}</m> is a function from <m>f(A)</m> to <m>A</m>.
            Now, since <m>A</m> is nonempty,
            there is an <m>a_0 \in A</m>.
            So define <m>h: B \to A</m> by
            <md>
              <mrow>h(b) = \begin{cases}\inv{f}(b) \amp  b \in f(A) \\ a_0 \amp  b \notin f(A) \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            for any <m>b \in B</m>.
            Recall that <m>h</m> is a left inverse of <m>f</m> if and only if
            <m>h \circ f = i_A</m> by definition, which we show now.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>a \in A</m> and let
            <m>b = f(a)</m> so that clearly <m>b \in f(A)</m>.
            Hence by definition <m>h(b) = \inv{f}(b) = \inv{f}(f(a)) = a</m>.
            Finally, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>(h \circ f)(a) = h(f(a)) = h(b) = a \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>h \circ f = i_A</m> since <m>a</m> was arbitrary.
            Therefore <m>h</m> is a left inverse of <m>f</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Note that this proof does not require the axiom of choice as we did not need to make a choice for each <m>b \in B</m> in order to define <m>h</m> as we did in part <m>A</m>.

            <m>\pset{\ca} \ss \ca</m> since <m>A</m> was arbitrary.
            Therefore the identity function
            <m>i_{\pset{\ca}}</m> is clearly an injection from <m>\pset{\ca}</m> to <m>\ca</m>.
            However, this is impossible by Theorem<nbsp/>7.8!

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>\cb \in \cb</m> so that by definition we have
            <m>\cb \in \ca</m> and <m>\cb \notin \cb</m>,
            the latter of which clearly contradicts our initial supposition.
            On the other hand, suppose that <m>\cb \notin \cb</m>.
            Then, since clearly also <m>\cb \in \ca</m> since it is a set,
            it follows that <m>\cb \in \cb</m> by definition.
            This again contradicts the initial supposition.
            Since one or the other (<m>\cb \in \cb</m> or <m>\cb \notin \cb</m>) must be true,
            we are then guaranteed to have a contradiction.

            There also cannot be an injection from <m>A</m> to <m>\pints</m>,

        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that each <m>A_n</m> is infinite by induction.
            Clearly <m>A_1 = \pints</m> is infinite.
            Now assume that <m>A_n</m> is infinite for

            Then <m>g \circ f</m> is an injection from <m>\pints</m> to <m>A_{n+1}</m> so that <m>A_{n+1}</m> is infinite as well by Theorem<nbsp/>9.1.

            Since clearly also <m>A_{n+1} \ss A</m>,
            it follows that <m>g \rest A_{n+1}</m> is then an injection of <m>A_{n+1}</m> into <m>A_n</m>.
            However this contradicts the proven fact that <m>A_{n+1}</m> has greater cardinality than <m>A_n</m>.
            Hence it has to be that no such injection <m>g</m> exists,
            which shows that <m>A</m> has greater cardinality than <m>A_n</m>.

        A famous conjecture of set theory,

        asserts that there exists no set having cardinality greater than <m>\pints</m> and lesser cardinality than <m>\reals</m>.
        The <em>generalized continuum hypothesis</em> asserts that,

        there is no set having greater cardinality than <m>A</m> and lesser cardinality than <m>\pset{A}</m>.
        Surprisingly enough,

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same cardinality there is a bijection <m>f : A \to B</m>.
            We define a bijection <m>g : \pset{A} \to \pset{B}</m>.
            So, for any <m>X \in \pset{A}</m>, set <m>g(X) = f(X)</m>.
            Clearly <m>f(X) \ss B</m>, since <m>B</m> is the range of <m>f</m>,
            so that <m>g(X) = f(X) \in \pset{B}</m> and hence
            <m>\pset{B}</m> can be the range of <m>g</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> is injective,
            consider sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> in
            <m>\pset{A}</m> so that <m>X,Y \ss A</m>.
            Also suppose that <m>X \neq Y</m> so,
            without loss of generality,
            we can assume that there is an <m>x \in X</m> where <m>x \notin Y</m>.
            Clearly <m>f(x) \in f(X)</m> since <m>x \in X</m>.
            Were it the case that <m>f(x) \in f(Y)</m> then there would be a <m>y \in Y</m> such that <m>f(y) = f(x)</m>.
            But then we would have that <m>y = x</m> since <m>f</m> is injective and hence <m>x = y \in Y</m>,
            which we know not to be the case.
            Hence <m>f(x) \notin f(Y)</m> so that it has to be that
            <m>g(X) = f(X) \neq f(Y) = g(Y)</m> since <m>f(x) \in f(X)</m>.
            Since <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> were arbitrary this shows that <m>g</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>g</m> is surjective consider any
            <m>Y \in \pset{B}</m> so that <m>Y \ss B</m>.
            Let <m>X = \inv{f}(Y)</m>,
            noting that <m>\inv{f}</m> is a bijection from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> since <m>f</m> is bijective.
            Clearly <m>X \ss A</m> since <m>A</m> is the range of <m>\inv{f}</m> so that <m>X \in \pset{A}</m>.
            Now consider any <m>y \in f(X)</m> so that there is an <m>x \in X</m> where <m>f(x) = y</m>.
            Then, since <m>X = \inv{f}(Y)</m>,
            there is a <m>y' \in Y</m> where <m>x = \inv{f}(y')</m>,
            and hence <m>y = f(x) = f(\inv{f}(y')) = y'</m>.
            Thus <m>y = y' \in Y</m> so that
            <m>f(X) \ss Y</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Now consider <m>y \in Y</m> and let
            <m>x = \inv{f}(y)</m> so that clearly <m>x = \inv{f}(y) \in \inv{f}(Y) = X</m>.
            Moreover, <m>f(x) = f(\inv{f}(y)) = y</m> so that <m>y \in f(X)</m>.
            Thus <m>Y \ss f(X)</m> as well since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>g(X) = f(X) = Y</m>,
            from which we conclude that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>Y</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence <m>g: \pset{A} \to \pset{B}</m> is a bijection so that <m>\pset{A}</m> and

        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this using the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein (CSB) Theorem,
            which was proven in Exercise<nbsp/>7.6 part<nbsp/>(b).
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we construct an injective function <m>f</m> from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\pset{\rats}</m>.
            For any <m>x \in \reals</m> let <m>Q = \braces{q \in \rats \where q \lt x}</m> so that clearly
            <m>Q \ss \rats</m> and hence <m>Q \in \pset{\rats}</m>.
            Therefore setting <m>f(x) = Q</m> means that <m>f</m> is a function from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\pset{\rats}</m>.
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective consider
            <m>x,y \in \reals</m> where <m>x \neq y</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that <m>x \lt y</m> so that there is a <m>q \in \rats</m> where
            <m>x \lt q \lt y</m> since the rationals are order-dense in the reals.
            Also set <m>Q = f(x)</m> and <m>P = f(y)</m>.
            Since <m>q > x</m> we have that <m>q \notin Q</m>.
            Analogously, since <m>q \lt y</m> we have that <m>q \in P</m>.
            Thus it has to be that <m>f(x) = Q \neq P = f(y)</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, it was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>7.1 that <m>\rats</m> is countably infinite and thus has the same cardinality as <m>\pints</m>.
            From <xref ref="lem_choice_psetsame">Lemma</xref>
            it then follows that <m>\pset{\rats}</m> has the same cardinality as
            <m>\pset{\pints}</m> so that there is a bijection <m>g: \pset{\rats} \to \pset{\pints}</m>.
            Clearly then <m>g \circ f</m> is an injection from <m>\reals</m> to <m>\pset{\pints}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>X = \braces{0,1}</m>,
            and we construct an injection <m>h : X^\w \to \reals</m>.
            For any sequence <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in X^\w</m> set <m>h(\vx)</m> to the decimal expansion <m>0.x_1 x_2 x_3 \ldots</m>,
            where clearly each <m>x_n</m> is the digit 0 or 1.
            Clearly <m>h(\vx)</m> is a real number so that <m>h</m> is a function from <m>X^\w</m> to <m>\reals</m>.
            It is easy to see that <m>h</m> is injective since different sequences will result in different decimal expansions.
            Since none of the expansions end in an infinite sequence of 9's, clearly the corresponding real numbers will be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, it was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>7.3 that
            <m>\pset{\pints}</m> and <m>X^\w</m> have the same cardinality so that there is a bijection <m>i : \pset{\pints} \to X^\w</m>.
            It then follows that <m>h \circ i</m> is an injection of <m>\pset{\pints}</m> into <m>\reals</m>.
            Since we have shown the existence of both injections,
            the result follows from the CSB Theorem.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt</m> and consider any <m>a \in A</m> where <m>a</m> is not the largest element.
            It then follows that there is some <m>x \in A</m> where <m>a \lt x</m> since otherwise <m>a</m> would be the largest element of <m>A</m>.
            Let <m>X = \braces{y \in A \where a \lt y}</m> so that clearly <m>X \ss A</m> and <m>x \in X</m>.
            Thus <m>X</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>A</m> and so has a smallest element <m>b</m> since <m>\lt</m> well-orders <m>A</m>.
            We claim that <m>b</m> is the immediate successor of <m>a</m>.
            To see this suppose that there is a <m>z \in A</m> such that <m>a \lt z \lt b</m>,
            noting that clearly <m>a \lt b</m> since <m>b \in X</m>.
            Then we would have that <m>z \in X</m> but <m>z \lt b</m> so that it is not true that <m>b \leq z</m>,
            which contradicts the definition of <m>b</m> as the smallest element of <m>X</m>.
            So it must be that no such <m>z</m> exists,
            which shows that <m>b</m> is indeed the immediate successor of <m>a</m>.

          (b) The most natural example of such a set is <m>\ints</m>.
          We show that this has the desired properties.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly <m>\ints</m> is not well-ordered since,
            for example,
            the set of negative integers is a nonempty subset of <m>\ints</m> but has no smallest element.
            Also, for any <m>n \in \ints</m>,
            clearly <m>n+1</m> is the immediate successor of <m>n</m>,
            which was shown back in <xref ref="cor_intreal_intbet">Corollary</xref>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          We claim that they do <em>not</em>
          have the same order type, which we show presently.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, clearly <m>(1,1)</m> is the smallest element of both ordered sets.
            For brevity let <m>A = \ot \times \pints</m>,
            <m>B = \pints \times \ot</m>,
            and <m>\lt _A</m> and <m>\lt _B</m> be the corresponding dictionary orderings,
            with <m>\lt</m> being the normal ordering of <m>\pints</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So assume that they <em>do</em>
            have the same order type so that there is an order-preserving bijection <m>f : A \to B</m>.
            Consider <m>(2,1) \in A</m>,
            which is clearly not the smallest element since <m>(2,1) \neq (1,1)</m>.
            Let <m>(n,b) = f(2,1) \in B</m>,
            which cannot be the smallest element of <m>B</m> since <m>f</m> preserves order,
            so that <m>(n,b) \neq (1,1)</m>.
            Clearly <m>b \in \ot</m> so that <m>b=1</m> or <m>b=2</m>.
            In the former cases we must have that <m>n > 1</m> so that <m>n-1 \in \pints</m>.
            So set <m>y = (n-1,2)</m>.
            In the latter case set <m>y = (n, 1)</m>.
            It is easy to see, and trivial to formally show,
            that <m>y</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>(n,b)</m> in either case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let <m>x = \inv{f}(y)</m>,
            noting that <m>\inv{f}</m> is an order-preserving bijection from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> since <m>f</m> is an order-preserving bijection.
            It then follows that <m>x \lt _A (2, 1)</m> since <m>f(x) = y \lt _B (n,b) = f(2,1)</m>.
            If <m>x = (m,a)</m> then it has to be that <m>m \lt 2</m> so that <m>m = 1</m>
            (because <m>m \in \ot</m>)
            since there is no <m>a \in \pints</m> where <m>a \lt 1</m>.
            Thus <m>x = (1, a)</m> for some <m>a \in \pints</m>.
            We then have that <m>a+1 \in \pints</m> so that clearly <m>x = (1, a) \lt _A (1, a+1) \lt _A (2,1)</m>.
            From this we have,
            <m>y = f(1,a) \lt _B f(1,a+1) \lt _B f(2,1) = (n,b)</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>y</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>(n,b)</m>.
            So it has to be that they do not have the same order type.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that, in the theory of ordinal numbers,
          <m>A = \ot \times \pints</m> has order type <m>\w + \w = \w \cdot 2</m> whereas
          <m>B = \pints \times \ot</m> has simply order type <m>\w</m>.
          This also shows that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have different order types since distinct ordinal numbers always have different order types.

            Let <m>A</m> be a set with simple order <m>\prec</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that <m>\prec</m> is not a well-ordering of <m>A</m>.
            Then there exists a nonempty subset <m>B</m> of <m>A</m> such that <m>B</m> has no smallest element.
            For any <m>b \in B</m> define the set <m>X_b = \braces{x \in B \where x \prec b}</m>.
            Clearly <m>X_b \ss B</m> and
            <m>X_b \neq \es</m> for any <m>b \in B</m> since otherwise <m>b</m> would be the smallest element of <m>B</m>.
            Now let <m>c</m> be a choice function on the collection of nonempty subsets of <m>B</m>,
            which of course exists by the axiom of choice.
            Since <m>B</m> is nonempty there is a <m>b_0 \in B</m>.
            It then follows from the principle of recursive definition that there is a function <m>f : \pints \to B</m> such that
            <md>
              <mrow>f(1) \amp = b_0 \,,</mrow>

            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            It then is easy to show that
            <m>f(n+1) \prec f(n)</m> for all <m>n \in \pints</m>,
            i.e. that the sequence defined by <m>f</m> is decreasing.
            If we then simply define <m>g : \nints \to \pints</m> by
            <m>g(n) = -n</m> for <m>n \in \nints</m>,
            it is clear that <m>f \circ g</m> is an order-preserving bijection from <m>\nints</m> to some subset <m>C</m> of <m>B</m>.
            Clearly also <m>C \ss A</m> since <m>B \ss A</m>.
            Hence the subset <m>C</m> has the same order type as <m>\nints</m>.

            Clearly then <m>B</m> is nonempty and has no smallest element since <m>\nints</m> does not.
            The existence of this <m>B</m> shows that <m>A</m> fails to be well-ordered.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is a set that is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> such that every countable subset is well-ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            Consider any nonempty subset <m>B \ss A</m>.
            Suppose for a moment that the restricted <m>\prec</m> does not well-order <m>B</m>.
            Then it follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>B</m> has a subset <m>C</m> with the same order type as <m>\nints</m>.
            However, clearly <m>C \ss A</m>
            (since <m>B \ss A</m>)
            and <m>C</m> is countable
            (since <m>\nints</m> is countable)
            and thus it should be well-ordered.
            As this is impossible since <m>C</m> has the same order-type as <m>\nints</m>
            (which is clearly not well-ordered),
            it has to be that the restricted <m>\prec</m> does in fact well-order <m>B</m>.
            Hence <m>B</m> has a <m>\prec</m>-smallest element,
            which shows that <m>A</m> is well-ordered since <m>B</m> was arbitrary.

            We construct a choice function <m>c : \col{A} \to \bigcup \col{A}</m>.
            Consider any set <m>A \in \col{A}</m>.
            Since clearly <m>A</m> is then a nonempty subset of <m>\bigcup \col{A}</m>,
            it follows that it has a unique smallest element <m>a</m> according to <m>\lt</m> since
            <m>\bigcup \col{A}</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt</m>.
            So simply set <m>c(A) = a</m> so that clearly then <m>c(A) = a \in A</m>.

            Suppose to the contrary that <m>S_\W</m> does have a largest element <m>\a</m>.
            Then, for any <m>x \in S_\W</m>,
            we have that <m>x \leq \a</m>.
            Hence either <m>x \in \braces{y \in S_\W \where y \lt \a} = S_\a</m> or <m>x = \a</m>.
            Therefore <m>S_\W = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> since clearly both <m>S_\a</m> and
            <m>\braces{\a}</m> are both subsets of <m>S_\W</m>.
            Now since <m>S_\a</m> is a section of <m>S_\W</m>, it is countable.
            Since <m>\braces{\a}</m> is also clearly countable,
            it follows from Theorem<nbsp/>7.5 that their union <m>S_\a \cup \braces{\a} = S_\W</m> is countable.
            But this contradicts the fact that <m>S_\W</m> is uncountable!
            Hence it has to be that <m>S_\W</m> has no largest element as desired.

            Consider any <m>\a \in S_\W</m>.
            Let <m>T_\a = \braces{x \in S_\W \where \a \lt x}</m> so that we must show that <m>T_\a</m> is uncountable.
            Let <m>\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> so that clearly we have that <m>\bar{S}_\a = \braces{x \in S_\W \where x \leq \a}</m>.
            It is then easy to show that <m>T_\a = S_\W - \bar{S}_\a</m>.
            Now, since <m>S_\a</m> is a section of <m>S_\W</m>,
            it is countable so that clearly
            <m>\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> is also countable by Theorem<nbsp/>7.5.
            Then, since <m>S_\W</m> itself is uncountable,

            First we show that <m>X_0</m> is not bounded above.
            Assume the contrary so that
            <m>\a \in S_\W</m> is an upper bound of <m>X_0</m>.
            It then follows that the set
            <m>T_\a = \braces{x \in S_\W \where \a \lt x}</m> is such that every element of <m>T_\a</m> has an immediate predecessor since otherwise there would be a <m>\b \in T_\a</m> where
            <m>\b \in X_0</m> so that <m>\a</m> would not be an upper bound of <m>X_0</m> since then <m>\a \lt \b</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we know from part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>S_\W</m> has no largest element so that it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>10.2 that every element of <m>S_\W</m> has an immediate successor.
            Since <m>T_\a \ss S_\W</m> it follows that each element
            <m>x \in T_\a</m> has an immediate successor <m>y</m>.
            Moreover we then have that
            <m>\a \lt x \lt y</m> so that <m>y \in T_\a</m> also.
            Hence every element of <m>T_\a</m> has an immediate successor in <m>T_\a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we know that <m>T_\a</m> is uncountable by part<nbsp/>(b) so that it has a smallest element <m>\b</m> since it is then a nonempty subset of the well-ordered <m>S_\W</m>.
            We derive a contradiction by showing that <m>T_\a</m> has the same order type as <m>\pints</m> and is thus countable.
            We do this by defining an increasing bijection <m>f: \pints \to T_\a</m>.
            First, set <m>f(1) = \b</m> and then set <m>f(n)</m> to the immediate successor of <m>f(n-1)</m> for <m>n > 1</m>,
            which was shown to exist above.
            Then the function <m>f</m> uniquely exists by the principle of recursive definition.
            Clearly we have that <m>f(n+1) > f(n)</m> for all
            <m>n \in \pints</m> since <m>f(n+1)</m> is the immediate successor of <m>f(n)</m>.
            Hence <m>f</m> is increasing and therefore also injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is surjective suppose the contrary so that the set <m>T_\a - f(\pints)</m> is nonempty.
            Since clearly this is a subset of the well-ordered <m>S_\W</m>,
            it has a smallest element <m>y</m>.
            Now, we know that <m>f(1) = \b</m> so that <m>y \neq \b</m>,
            and in fact <m>\b \lt y</m> since <m>\b</m> is the smallest element of <m>T_\a</m>.
            Since <m>y \in T_\a</m> we know that it has an immediate predecessor <m>x</m> and that
            <m>\a \lt \b \leq x</m> so that <m>x \in T_\a</m>.
            However, it cannot be that
            <m>x \in T_\a - f(\pints)</m> since <m>x \lt y</m> and <m>y</m> is the smallest element of <m>T_\a - f(\pints)</m>.
            Thus <m>x \in f(\pints)</m> so that there is an
            <m>n \in \pints</m> where <m>f(n) = x</m>.
            But then <m>f(n+1) = y</m> since <m>y</m> is the immediate successor of <m>x</m>.
            As this contradicts the fact that <m>y \notin f(\pints)</m>,
            it must be that <m>f</m> is in fact surjective!
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore we have shown that <m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>\pints</m> to <m>T_\a</m> so that <m>T_\a</m> is countable.
            But we know from part<nbsp/>(b) that <m>T_\a</m> is uncountable.
            As mentioned above,
            this is a contradiction so that it must be that indeed <m>X_0</m> is not bounded above.
            From this it immediately follows from the contrapositive of Theorem<nbsp/>10.3 that <m>X_0</m> must be uncountable.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          It is interesting to note that <m>S_\W</m> corresponds to the ordinal number <m>\w_1</m>,
          which is the first uncountable ordinal,
          and the set <m>X_0</m> of part<nbsp/>(c) corresponds to the set of limit ordinals in <m>\w_1</m>.
          All of the curious properties deduced here for <m>S_\W</m> apply to <m>\w_1</m> too,
          assuming we allow the choice axiom.

          Let <m>J</m> be a well-ordered set.
          A subset <m>J_0</m> of <m>J</m> is said to be

          <em>Theorem (The principle of transfinite induction).</em>
          If <m>J</m> is a well-ordered set and <m>J_0</m> is an inductive subset of <m>J</m>,
          then <m>J_0 = J</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>J_0</m> is an inductive subset of the well-ordered set <m>J</m>.
            Also suppose that <m>J_0 \neq J</m>.
            Since <m>J_0 \ss J</m>,
            it follows that there must be an <m>x \in J</m> such that <m>x \notin J_0</m>.
            Thus the set <m>J - J_0</m> is nonempty.
            Since clearly this is also a subset of <m>J</m>,
            it must have a smallest element <m>\a</m> since <m>J</m> is well-ordered.
            Consider any <m>y \in S_\a</m> so that <m>y \lt \a</m>.
            Then it cannot be that <m>y \in J - J_0</m> since otherwise <m>\a</m> would not be the smallest element of <m>J - J_0</m>.
            Since clearly <m>y \in J</m>
            (since <m>S_\a \ss J</m>)
            it has to be that <m>y \in J_0</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>S_\a \ss J_0</m>.
            It then follows that <m>\a \in J_0</m> since <m>J_0</m> is inductive.
            However, this contradicts the fact that
            <m>\a \in J - J_0</m> so that our initial supposition that <m>J_0 \neq J</m> must be incorrect.
            Hence <m>J_0 = J</m> as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            It is easy but tedious to show that <m>\lt</m> is actually an order on <m>A_1 \cup A_2</m>,
            so we shall skip that proof and jump straight to the proof that it is a well-ordering.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any nonempty subset <m>A</m> of <m>A_1 \cup A_2</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>A_1 \cap A \neq \es</m>.
            Then clearly <m>A_1 \cap A</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>A_1</m> so that it has a smallest element <m>a</m> according to <m>\lt _1</m> since it is a well-ordering.
            We then claim that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m> according to <m>\lt</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in A</m> so that clearly also <m>x \in A_1 \cup A_2</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in A_1</m> or <m>x \in A_2</m>.
            If <m>x \in A_1</m> then obviously <m>x \in A_1 \cap A</m> so that
            <m>a \leq_1 x</m> since <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A_1 \cap A</m>.
            Then also <m>a \leq x</m> by definition since <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> are both in <m>A_1</m>.
            On the other hand,
            if <m>x \in A_2</m> then we again have that <m>a \lt x</m> since
            <m>a \in A_1</m> and <m>x \in A_2</m>.
            Therefore <m>a \leq x</m> no matter what so that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>A_1 \cap A = \es</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>A_2 \cap A \neq \es</m> since <m>A</m> is nonempty and <m>A = A_1 \cup A_2</m>.
            Thus <m>A_2 \cap A</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>A_2</m> so that it has a smallest element <m>a</m> by <m>\lt _2</m> since it is a well-ordering.
            We claim that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in A</m>.
            It has to be that <m>x \in A_2</m> since
            <m>A_1 \cap A</m> is empty and <m>A = A_1 \cup A_2</m>.
            Therefore <m>x \in A_2 \cap A</m> so that
            <m>a \leq_2 x</m> since <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A_2 \cap A</m>.
            Then, by definition,
            <m>a \leq x</m> since both <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> are elements of <m>A_2</m>.
            This shows that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m> since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In either case we have shown that <m>A</m> has a smallest element so that <m>\lt</m> is a well-ordering of
            <m>A_1 \cup A_2</m> since <m>A</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Note that well-ordering a union of two well-ordered sets like this is analogous to the addition of two ordinal numbers.
          In particular if <m>A_1</m> has order type <m>\a_1</m> and <m>A_1</m> has order type <m>\a_2</m> where <m>\a_1</m> and <m>\a_2</m> are an ordinal numbers,
          then <m>A_1 \cup A_2</m> with the above well-ordering has order type <m>\a_1 + \a_2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Suppose that <m>J</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt _J</m> and
          <m>\braces{A_\a}_{\a \in J}</m> is a collection of well-ordered sets where <m>A_\a</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt _\a</m> for each <m>\a \in J</m>.
          Now define an order <m>\lt</m> on <m>A = \bigcup_{\a \in J} A_\a</m> as follows.
          For any <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>A</m> there are clearly <m>\a</m> and <m>\b</m> in <m>J</m> where
          <m>x \in A_\a</m> and <m>y \in A_\b</m>,
          noting that <m>\a</m> and <m>\b</m> are unique since the collection is mutually disjoint.
          So set <m>x \lt y</m> if and only if either <m>\a = \b</m> and <m>x \lt _\a y</m>,
          or else <m>\a \lt _J \b</m>, noting that these are clearly mutually exclusive.
          We then claim that <m>\lt</m> is a well-ordering of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>B</m> be any nonempty subset of <m>A</m> and <m>I</m> be the set of
            <m>\a \in J</m> such that there is an <m>x \in B</m> where <m>x \in A_\a</m>.
            Now, since <m>B</m> is nonempty,
            there is a <m>z \in B</m>.
            Since <m>B \ss A = \bigcup_{\a \in J} A_\a</m>,
            there is an <m>\g \in J</m> where <m>z \in A_\g</m>.
            Then clearly <m>\g \in I</m> so that <m>I</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>J</m>.
            Then <m>I</m> has a smallest element <m>\a</m> since it is well-ordered by <m>\lt _J</m>.
            By the definition of <m>I</m> there is a <m>w \in B</m> where <m>w \in A_\a</m>.
            Then clearly <m>w \in A_\a \cap B</m> so that it is a nonempty subset of <m>A_\a</m>.
            It then follows that <m>A_\a \cap B</m> has a smallest element <m>a</m> according to <m>\lt _\a</m> since it is a well-ordering on <m>A_\a</m>.
            We claim that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>B</m> by <m>\lt</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>x \in B</m> so that there is a <m>\b \in J</m> where
            <m>x \in A_\b</m> since <m>B \ss A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\b = \a</m>.
            Then both <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>A_\a \cap B = A_\b \cap B</m> so that
            <m>a \leq_\a b</m> since <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>A_\a \cap B</m>.
            It then follows from the definition of <m>\lt</m> that <m>a \leq x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>\b \neq \a</m>.
            Clearly then <m>\b \in I</m> so that
            <m>\a \leq_J \b</m> since <m>\a</m> is the smallest element of <m>J</m>.
            Since we know that <m>\b \neq \a</m> it must be that <m>\a \lt _J \b</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>a \lt x</m> by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in either case it is true that <m>a \leq x</m>,
            which shows that <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>B</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary nonempty subset of <m>A</m>,
            this shows that <m>A</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt</m>.

          <p>
            We claim that the section <m>S_\va</m> has the same order type as <m>(\pints)^n</m>.
            To show this we construct an order-preserving mapping <m>f: S_\va \to (\pints)^n</m>.
            So consider any sequence <m>\vx = \seqinf{x}</m> in <m>S_\va</m> so that <m>\vx \lt \va</m>.
            Now define a finite sequence where
            <m>y_i = x_{n-i+1}</m> for any <m>i \in \intsfin{n}</m>,
            and set <m>f(\vx) = \vy = \seqfin{y}{n}</m>.
            Clearly <m>f(\vx) \in (\pints)^n</m> since <m>\vx \in A \ss (\pints)^\w</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we must digress for a moment and show that,
            for all <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in A</m>,
            <m>\vx \in S_\va</m> if and only if <m>x_i = 1</m> for all <m>i > n</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> We show the contrapositive.
            So suppose that there is an <m>i > n</m> where <m>x_i \neq 1</m>.
            Moreover let <m>i</m> be the greatest such index,
            which must exist since <m>\vx</m> must end in an infinite string of 1's.
            Clearly then the fact that <m>x_i \in \pints</m> and
            <m>x_i \neq 1</m> means that <m>x_i > 1</m>.
            Now, if <m>i > n+1</m> then we have that <m>x_i > 1 = a_i</m> and
            <m>x_j = 1 = a_j</m> for all <m>j > i</m> so that clearly <m>\vx > \va</m>.
            If <m>i = n + 1</m> and <m>i > 2</m> clearly <m>x_i > 2 = a_{n+1} = a_i</m> and
            <m>x_j = 1 = a_j</m> for all <m>j > i</m> so that again <m>\vx > \va</m>.
            Lastly suppose that <m>i = n+1</m> but that <m>x_i = 2 = a_{n+1} = a_i</m>.
            If <m>x_j = 1 = a_j</m> for all
            <m>j \lt i = n+1</m> then clearly <m>\vx = \va</m>.
            On the other hand if there is a <m>1 \leq j \lt n+1 = i</m> where
            <m>x_j \neq 1</m> then let <m>j</m> be the greatest such index.
            Then we clearly have <m>x_j > 1 = a_j</m> while
            <m>x_k = a_k</m> for all <m>k > j</m> so that <m>\vx > \va</m>.
            Therefore in every one of these exhaustive cases we have that
            <m>\vx \geq \va</m> so that <m>\va \notin S_\va</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that <m>x_i = 1</m> for every <m>i > n</m>.
            Then we have that <m>x_{n+1} = 1 \lt 2 = a_{n+1}</m> while
            <m>x_j = 1 = a_j</m> for all <m>j > n+1 > n</m> so that
            <m>\vx \lt \va</m> and hence <m>\vx \in S_\va</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, returning to the main proof,
            we first show that <m>f</m> as defined above preserves order.
            To this end let <m>\prec</m> denote the dictionary order on <m>(\pints)^n</m>.
            Now consider any <m>\vx = \seqinf{x}</m> and
            <m>\vx' = \seqinf{x'}</m> in <m>S_\va</m> where <m>\vx \lt  \vx'</m>.
            Also let <m>\vy = f(\vx)</m> and <m>\vy' = f(\vx')</m>.
            Then there is an <m>m \in \pints</m> where <m>x_m \lt  x_m'</m> and
            <m>x_i = x_i'</m> for all <m>i > m</m>.
            We also have by what was shown above that
            <m>x_i = 1 x_i'</m> for all <m>i > n</m> since <m>\vx,\vx' \in S_\va</m>.
            So it has to be that <m>m \leq n</m>.
            It then follows from the fact that
            <m>1 \leq m \leq n</m> that <m>1 \leq n-m+1 \leq n</m> as well.
            Thus we have
            <md>
              <mrow>y_{n-m+1} = x_{n-(n-m+1)+1} = x_m \lt  x_m' = x_{n-(n-m+1)+1}' = y_{n-m+1}' \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For any <m>1 \leq j \lt  n-m+1</m> we have that <m>n-j+1 > m</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>y_j = x_{n-j+1} = x_{n-j+1}' = y_j' \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus by definition we have that <m>f(\vx) = \vy \prec \vy' = f(\vx')</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> preserves order since <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vx'</m> were arbitrary.
            Note that this also clearly shows that <m>f</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>f</m> is also surjective,
            consider any <m>\vy = \seqfin{y}{n} \in (\pints)^n</m>.
            Now define a sequence
            <md>
              <mrow>x_i = \begin{cases}y_{n-i+1} \amp  1 \leq i \leq n \\ 1 \amp  i > n \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            so that clearly <m>\vx = \seqinf{x} \in S_\va</m> by what was shown above.
            Now let <m>\vy' = \seqfin{y'}{n} = f(\vx)</m>.
            Consider any <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m> and let
            <m>j = n-i+1</m> so that also <m>n-j+1 = i</m>,
            noting also that <m>1 \leq j \leq n</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>y_i = y_{n-j+1} = x_j = x_{n-i+1} = y_i'</mrow>
            </md>
            by the definition of <m>f</m>.
            Since <m>i</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>f(\vx) = \vy' = \vy</m>,
            which shows that <m>f</m> is surjective since <m>\vy</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The existence of <m>f</m> therefore shows that <m>S_\va</m> and
            <m>(\pints)^n</m> have the same order type.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any nonempty subset <m>B</m> of <m>A</m>.
            Clearly the sequence <m>(1, 1, \ldots)</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m> and hence if it is in <m>B</m> then it is also the smallest element of <m>B</m>.
            So suppose that <m>(1, 1, \ldots) \notin B</m> so that,
            for every <m>\vx \in B</m> there is a unique greatest <m>n_\vx \in \pints</m> where
            <m>x_{n_\vx} > 1</m> but <m>x_i = 1</m> for all <m>i > n_\vx</m>.
            So let <m>I = \braces{n_\vx \where \vx \in B}</m>,
            noting that <m>B \neq \es</m> implies that <m>I \neq \es</m> as well.
            Thus <m>I</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\pints</m> and hence has a smallest element <m>n</m>.
            If we then let <m>B_n</m> be the set of sequences
            <m>\vx \in B</m> where <m>x_n > 1</m> but <m>x_i = 1</m> for all <m>i > n</m>,
            then the fact that <m>n \in I</m> clearly implies that <m>B_n \neq \es</m>.
            Also, if we define the sequence
            <md>
              <mrow>a_i = \begin{cases}2 \amp  i = n+1 \\ 1 \amp  i \neq n+1 \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
            as in part<nbsp/>(a) then it follows from what was shown there that <m>B_n \ss S_\va</m>.
            Moreover it was shown that <m>S_\va</m> has the same order type as the dictionary order of <m>(\pints)^n</m>,
            which we know to be a well-ordering.
            Hence <m>S_\va</m> must also be a well-ordering so that <m>B_n</m> has a smallest element
            <m>\vb = \seqinf{b}</m> since it is a nonempty subset of <m>S_\va</m>.
            We claim that <m>\vb</m> is in fact the smallest element of all of <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>\vx \in B</m> so that <m>n_\vx \in I</m>.
            It then follows that <m>n \leq n_\vx</m> since it is the smallest element of <m>I</m>.
            If <m>n = n_\vx</m> then we have that <m>\vx \in B_n</m> so that
            <m>\vb \leq \vx</m> since it is the smallest element of <m>B_n</m>.
            If <m>n \lt n_\vx</m> then we have that <m>b_{n_\vx} = 1 \lt x_{n_\vx}</m> but
            <m>b_i = 1 = x_i</m> for every <m>i > n_\vx > n</m>.
            This shows that <m>\vb \lt \vx</m>.
            Thus in all cases <m>\vb \leq \vx</m>,
            which shows that <m>\vb</m> is the smallest element of <m>B</m> since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.
            Since <m>B</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>A</m> is well-ordered as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Note that, in the theory of ordinal numbers, the set <m>(\pints)^n</m>
          (and therefore the corresponding section of <m>A</m>)
          has order type <m>\w^n</m>.
          It would seem then that the set <m>A</m> has order type <m>\w^\w</m>.

          <p>
            Let <m>J_0 = \braces{x \in J \where P(x)}</m>.
            We show that <m>J_0</m> is inductive.
            So consider any <m>\a \in J</m> and suppose that <m>S_\a \ss J_0</m>.

            It then follows that <m>P(\a)</m> is also true since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,

            Since <m>\a \in J</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>J_0</m> is inductive.
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>10.7 that <m>J_0 = J</m>.
            So consider any <m>\b \in J</m> so that also

        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that the domains of <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are sets <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> where each is either a section of <m>J</m> or <m>J</m> itself.
            Since this is the case,
            we can assume without loss of generality that <m>H \ss K</m> and so <m>H</m> is exactly the domain common to both <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>.
            Now suppose that the hypothesis we are trying to prove is <em>not</em>
            true so that there is an <m>x</m> in both domains (i.e.
            <m>x \in H</m>) where <m>h(x) \neq k(x)</m>.
            We can also assume that <m>x</m> is the smallest such element since <m>H \ss J</m> and <m>J</m> is well-ordered.
            It then clearly follows that
            <m>S_x \ss H</m> is a section of <m>J</m> and that
            <m>h(y) = k(y)</m> for all <m>y \in S_x</m>.
            From this we clearly have that <m>h(S_x) = k(S_x)</m>.
            But then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = \text{ smallest[\(C - h(S_x)\)] }  = \text{ smallest[\(C - k(S_x)\)] }  = k(x)</mrow>
            </md>
            since both <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> satisfy <m>(*)</m> and <m>x</m> is in the domain of both.
            This contradicts the supposition that
            <m>h(x) \neq k(x)</m> so that it must be that no such <m>x</m> exists and hence <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are the same in their common domain as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>h : S_\a \to C</m> is such a function satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
            Now let <m>\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> and we define <m>k : \bar{S}_\a \to C</m> as follows.
            For any <m>x \in \bar{S}_\a</m> set
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = \begin{cases}h(x) \amp  x \in S_\a \\ \text{ smallest[\(C - h(S_\a)\)] }  \amp  x = \a \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We note that clearly <m>S_\a</m> and
            <m>\braces{\a}</m> are disjoint so that this is unambiguous.
            We also note that <m>h</m> is not surjective onto <m>C</m> since <m>S_\a</m> is a section of <m>J</m>,
            and hence <m>C - h(S_\a) \neq \es</m> and so has a smallest element since <m>C</m> is well-ordered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>k</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            First, clearly <m>h(S_x) = k(S_x)</m> for any <m>x \leq \a</m> since
            <m>k(y) = h(y)</m> by definition for any <m>y \in S_x \ss S_\a</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x \in \bar{S}_\a</m>.
            If <m>x = \a</m> then by definition we have
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = \text{ smallest[\(C - h(S_\a)\)] }  = \text{ smallest[\(C - k(S_\a)\)] }  = \text{ smallest[\(C - k(S_x)\)] }  \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if <m>x \in S_\a</m> then <m>x \lt  \a</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = h(x) = \text{ smallest[\(C - h(S_x)\)] }  = \text{ smallest[\(C - k(S_x)\)] }</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>h</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Therefore, since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>k</m> also satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>

          (c)

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let

              <mrow>k = \bigcup_{\a \in K} h_\a \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which we claim is the function we seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>k</m> is actually a function from <m>\bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m> to <m>C</m>.
            So consider any <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>k</m>.
            Suppose that <m>(x, a)</m> and <m>(x, b)</m> are both in <m>k</m> so that there are <m>\a</m> and <m>\b</m> in <m>K</m> where
            <m>(x, a) \in h_\a</m> and <m>(x, b) \in h_\b</m>.
            Since <m>h_\a</m> and <m>h_\b</m> both satisfy <m>(*)</m>,
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that
            <m>a = h_\a(x) = h_\b(x) = b</m> since clearly <m>x</m> is in the domain of both.
            This shows that <m>k</m> is indeed a function since <m>(x,a)</m> and <m>(x,b)</m> were arbitrary.
            Also clearly the domain of <m>k</m> is <m>\bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m> since,
            for any <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m>,
            we have that there is an <m>\a \in K</m> where <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Hence <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>h_\a</m> and so in the domain of <m>k</m>.
            In the other direction,
            clearly if <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>k</m> then it is in the domain of <m>h_\a</m> for some <m>\a \in K</m>.
            Since this domain is <m>S_\a</m>,
            clearly <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m>.
            Lastly, obviously the range of <m>k</m> can be <m>C</m> since this is the range of every <m>h_\a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>k</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m> so that
            <m>x \in S_\a</m> for some <m>\a \in K</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>k(y) = h_\a(y)</m> for every
            <m>y \in S_\a</m> since <m>h_\a \ss k</m>.
            It then immediately follows that <m>k(x) = h(x)</m> and
            <m>k(S_x) = h_\a(S_x)</m> since <m>S_x \ss S_\a</m>.
            Then, since <m>h_\a</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = h_\a(x) = \text{ smallest[\(C - h_\a(S_x)\)] }  = \text{ smallest[\(C - k(S_x)\)] }  \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>k</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>\b \in J</m> and suppose that,
            for every <m>x \in S_\b</m>,
            there is a function <m>h_x : S_x \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
            Now, if <m>\b</m> has an immediate predecessor <m>\a</m> then we claim that <m>S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            First if <m>x \in S_\b</m> then <m>x \lt \b</m> so that
            <m>x \leq \a</m> since <m>\a</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\b</m>.
            If <m>x \lt \a</m> then <m>x \in S_\a</m> and if <m>x = \a</m> then <m>x \in \braces{\a}</m>.
            Hence in either case we have that <m>x \in S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            If <m>x \in S_\a</m> then <m>x \lt \a \lt \b</m> so that <m>s \in S_\b</m>.
            On the other hand if <m>x \in \braces{\a}</m> then
            <m>x = \a \lt \b</m> so that again <m>x \in S_\b</m>.
            Thus we have shown that <m>S_\b \ss S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> and
            <m>S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \ss S_\b</m> so that <m>S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            Since <m>\a \in S_\b</m> it follows that there is an
            <m>h_\a : S_\a \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Then, by part<nbsp/>(b),
            we have that there is an <m>h_\b : S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \to C</m> that also satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>\b</m> does not have an immediate predecessor then we claim that <m>S_\b = \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in S_\b</m> so that <m>x \lt \b</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> cannot be the immediate predecessor of <m>\b</m>,
            there must be an <m>\a</m> where <m>x \lt \a \lt \b</m>.
            Then <m>x \in S_\a</m> so that,
            since <m>\a \lt \b</m>, clearly <m>x \in \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m> so that there is an
            <m>\a \lt \b</m> where <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Then clearly <m>x \lt \a \lt \b</m> so that also <m>x \in S_\b</m>.
            Thus we have shown that <m>S_\b \ss \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m> and
            <m>\bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g \ss S_\b</m> so that <m>S_\b = \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m>.
            Now, clearly <m>S_\b</m> is a subset of <m>J</m> where there is an
            <m>h_x : S_x \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m> for every <m>x \in S_\b</m>.
            Then it follows from what was shown in part<nbsp/>(c) that there is a function <m>h_\b</m> from
            <m>\bigcup_{\g \lt S_\b} S_\g = \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g = S_\b</m> to <m>C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, in either case,
            we have shown that there is an
            <m>h_\b : S_\b \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            The desired result then follows by transfinite induction.

        <p>
          (e)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>J</m> has no largest element.
            Then we claim that <m>J = \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>.
            For any <m>x \in J</m> there must be a <m>y \in J</m> where <m>x \lt y</m> since <m>x</m> cannot be the greatest element of <m>J</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in S_y</m> so that also clearly <m>\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>.
            Then, for any <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>,
            there is an <m>\a \in J</m> where <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Clearly <m>S_\a \ss J</m> so that <m>x \in J</m> also.
            Hence <m>J \ss \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m> and
            <m>\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a \ss J</m> so that <m>J = \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>.
            Since we know from part<nbsp/>(d) that there is an
            <m>h_\a : S_\a \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m> for every <m>\a \in J</m>,
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(c) that there is a function <m>h</m> from
            <m>\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a = J</m> to <m>C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>J</m> does have a largest element <m>\b</m> then clearly <m>J = S_\b \cup \braces{\b}</m>.
            Since we know that there is an
            <m>h_\b : S_\b \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m> by part<nbsp/>(d),
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(b) that there is a function <m>h</m> from
            <m>S_\b \cup \braces{\b} = J</m> to <m>C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Hence the desired function <m>h</m> exists in both cases. part<nbsp/>(a) also clearly shows that this function is unique.

              For well-ordered sets <m>A \neq \es</m> and <m>B</m> there is an injection from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> if and only if there is a surjection from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.

          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that there is an injection
            <m>f: A \to B</m> and <m>A \neq \es</m>.
            Then there is an <m>a \in A</m>.
            We then construct a surjection <m>g : B \to A</m> as follows.
            For any <m>y \in B</m> if <m>b \in f(A)</m> then there is a unique <m>x \in A</m> where <m>y = f(x)</m>.
            It is unique since,
            if <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> are in <m>A</m> where <m>f(x) = y = f(x')</m>,
            then <m>x = x'</m> since <m>f</m> is injective.
            So in this case set <m>g(y) = x</m>.
            If <m>b \notin f(A)</m>, then set <m>g(y) = a</m>.
            Clearly <m>g</m> is a function from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.
            To show that <m>g</m> is surjective,
            consider any <m>x \in A</m> and let <m>y = f(x)</m>,
            which is clearly an element of <m>B</m>.
            Then, since obviously <m>y \in f(A)</m> and <m>x</m> is the unique <m>x \in A</m> such that <m>y = f(x)</m>,
            we have that <m>g(y) = x</m> by definition.
            This shows that <m>g</m> is surjective since <m>x</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\pmi)</m> Now suppose that <m>g: B \to A</m> is surjective.
            We then construct an injection <m>f: A \to B</m> as follows.
            For any <m>x \in A</m> we have that the set
            <m>B_x = \braces{y \in B \where g(y) = x}</m> is nonempty since <m>g</m> is surjective.
            Hence <m>B_x</m> has a unique smallest element <m>y</m> since it is a nonempty subset of <m>B</m> and <m>B</m> is well-ordered.
            So simply set <m>f(x) = y</m>.
            Clearly <m>f</m> is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
            To show that <m>f</m> is injective,
            consider <m>x,x' \in A</m> where <m>x \neq x'</m>.
            Then clearly the sets <m>B_x</m> and <m>B_{x'}</m> have to be disjoint for otherwise there would be a <m>y \in B</m> where
            <m>g(y) = x</m> and <m>g(y) = x'</m>,
            which is impossible if <m>x \neq x'</m> since <m>g</m> is a function.
            Hence, since <m>f(x)</m> and <m>f(x')</m> are defined to be the smallest elements of <m>B_x</m> and <m>B_{x'}</m>,
            respectively,
            we have <m>f(x) \neq f(x')</m>.
            This shows that <m>f</m> is injective since <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> were arbitrary.

          <em>Main Problem.</em>
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are each well-ordered,
            which follows from the well-ordering theorem.
            Also suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> do <em>not</em>
            have the same cardinality so that it suffices to show that either <m>B</m> has greater cardinality than <m>A</m> or vice versa.
            If <m>A = \es</m> then it cannot be that <m>B = \es</m> as well since then they would have the same cardinality
            (<m>\es</m> would be a trivial bijection between them).
            Hence <m>B \neq \es</m> so that clearly <m>B</m> has greater cardinality than <m>A</m>.
            Thus in what follows assume that <m>A \neq \es</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose that there is an injection from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>.
            Then there cannot be an injection from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> since,
            if there were,
            then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> would have the same cardinality by the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem (shown in Exercise<nbsp/>7.6 part<nbsp/>(b)).
            Thus <m>B</m> has greater cardinality than <m>A</m> by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand,
            if there is no injection from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> then there is no surjection from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> by <xref ref="lem_wellord_injsur">Lemma</xref>
            since they are both well-ordered and <m>A \neq \es</m>.
            It then clearly follows that no section of <m>B</m> can be a surjection onto <m>A</m> since then any extension of such a function to all of <m>B</m> would also be a surjection onto <m>A</m>.
            From this we have by Exercise<nbsp/>10.10 that there is a unique function
            <m>h : B \to A</m> with the property that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = \text{ smallest[\(A - h(S_x)\)] }  \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where of course <m>S_x</m> is the section of <m>B</m> by <m>x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We claim that <m>h</m> is injective.
            So consider any <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> in <m>B</m> where <m>y \neq y'</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that <m>y \lt y'</m>
            (by the well-ordering on <m>B</m>).
            It then follows that <m>y \in S_{y'}</m> so that clearly <m>h(y) \in h(S_{y'})</m>.
            However, we have that <m>h(y')</m> is the smallest element of
            <m>A - h(S_{y'})</m> so that obviously <m>h(y') \notin h(S_{y'})</m>.
            Hence it must be that <m>h(y) \neq h(y')</m>,
            which shows that <m>h</m> is injective since <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore there is an injection from <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> but none from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> so that <m>A</m> has greater cardinality than <m>B</m> by definition.
            This shows the desired result since these cases are exhaustive.

            First consider any <m>a \in \reals</m> so that <m>a-a = 0</m>,

            is also rational and positive since both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are.
            Thus <m>a \prec c</m>, which shows that <m>\prec</m> is transitive.
            Since <m>\prec</m> was shown to be nonreflexive and transitive,
            this shows that it is a strict partial order as desired.

          For any element <m>x \in \reals</m>,
          define the set <m>A_x = \braces{y \in \reals \where x - y \in \rats}</m>.
          We then claim that the collection
          <m>\cA = \braces{A_x}_{x \in \reals}</m> is exactly the set of all maximal simply ordered subsets.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>\cB</m> is the set of maximally simply ordered subsets of <m>\reals</m>.
            Then we show that <m>\cA = \cB</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>\cA \ss \cB</m> consider any
            <m>X \in \cA</m> so that <m>X = A_x</m> for some <m>x \in \reals</m>.
            Now consider any distinct <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> in <m>X = A_x</m> so that by definition <m>x - y</m> and <m>x - z</m> are both rational so that <m>z - x = -(x-z)</m> is also rational.
            Then clearly <m>z - y = (z-x) + (x-y)</m> is rational as is <m>y - z = -(z-y)</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are distinct,
            we have that <m>z-y</m> and <m>y-z</m> are nonzero and that either <m>y \lt z</m> or <m>z \lt y</m>.
            In the former case we have that <m>z - y</m> is a positive rational number and in the latter <m>y - z</m> is.
            Thus either <m>y \prec z</m> or <m>z \prec y</m>,
            which shows that <m>X = A_x</m> is simply ordered since <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> were arbitrary.
            Now consider any <m>y \in A_x</m> and
            <m>z \notin A_x</m> so that <m>x-y</m> is rational but <m>x-z</m> is irrational so that <m>z-x=-(x-z)</m> is also irrational.
            Since a rational added to an irrational is also irrational
            (which is trivially easy to prove),
            it follows that <m>z - y = (z-x) + (x-y)</m> is irrational as is <m>y-z = -(z-y)</m>.
            Hence it cannot be that either <m>y \prec z</m> or <m>z \prec y</m>.
            Since <m>y \in X</m> and <m>z \notin X</m> were arbitrary,
            this show that <m>X</m> is a maximal simply ordered set so that <m>X \in \cB</m>.
            This shows that <m>\cA \ss \cB</m> since <m>X</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>X \in \cB</m> so that <m>X</m> is a maximal simply ordered set.
            It follows from <xref ref="lem_maximum_nonempty">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>X</m> is nonempty so that there is an <m>x \in X</m>,
            and we claim that in fact <m>X = A_x</m>.
            So consider any <m>y \in X</m>.
            Clearly if <m>y = x</m> then
            <m>x-y = x-x = 0 \in \rats</m> so that <m>y \in A_x</m>.
            If <m>y \neq x</m> than either <m>x \prec y</m> or
            <m>y \prec x</m> since <m>X</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            In the former case we have that <m>y-x</m> is positive and rational so that
            <m>x-y = -(y-x)</m> is negative and rational,
            and hence <m>y \in A_x</m>.
            In the latter case we have that <m>x-y</m> is positive and rational so that clearly again <m>y \in A_x</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>X \ss A_x</m>.
            Now consider any <m>y \in A_x</m> so that <m>x-y \in \rats</m>.
            If <m>y = x</m> then clearly <m>y \in X</m>.
            If <m>y \neq x</m> then either <m>y-x</m> or <m>x-y</m> is positive,
            and also clearly rational since <m>x-y</m> is rational.
            Hence either <m>x \prec y</m> or <m>y \prec x</m>.
            It then follows from the fact that <m>X</m> is <em>maximally</em>
            simply ordered that <m>y</m> must be in <m>X</m> since otherwise <m>y</m> would not be comparable with <m>x</m>.
            Since again <m>y</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>A_x \ss X</m>.
            Hence <m>X = A_x</m> so that clearly <m>X \in \braces{A_x}_{x \in \reals} = \cA</m>.
            Since <m>X</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>\cB \ss \cA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore we have shown that <m>\cA = \cB</m>,
            which shows that <m>\cA</m> is exactly the complete set of maximally simply ordered subsets.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          As an example of a particular maximally well-ordered set we have <m>\rats = A_0</m> itself.

        <proof>
          <p>
            We show that <m>\eprec</m> satisfies the three partial order axioms:
          </p>
          <p>
            (i) Consider any <m>a \in A</m>.
            Since obviously <m>a=a</m> we have by definition that <m>a \eprec a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (ii) Suppose that <m>a \eprec b</m> and <m>b \eprec a</m>.
            Then either <m>a \prec b</m> or <m>a = b</m>,
            and either <m>b \prec a</m> or <m>b = a</m>.
            So suppose that <m>a \neq b</m> so that it must be that
            <m>a \prec b</m> and <m>b \prec a</m>.
            Since <m>\prec</m> is a strict partial order,
            it is transitive so that <m>a \prec a</m> since
            <m>a \prec b</m> and <m>b \prec a</m>.
            But this contradicts the nonreflexivity of <m>\prec</m>.
            Hence it must be that <m>a = b</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            (iii) Suppose that <m>a \eprec b</m> and <m>b \eprec c</m>.
            Hence either <m>a \prec b</m> or <m>a = b</m>,
            and either <m>b \prec c</m> or <m>b = c</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a \prec b</m>.
            If <m>b \prec c</m> then clearly
            <m>a \prec c</m> since <m>\prec</m> is transitive
            (since it is a strict partial order).
            If <m>b = c</m> then we have that <m>a \prec b = c</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>a = b</m>.
            If <m>b \prec c</m> then we have that <m>a = b \prec c</m>.
            If <m>b = c</m> then we have that <m>a = b = c</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in all cases and sub-cases we have that <m>a \prec c</m> or <m>a = c</m>,
            and thus <m>a \eprec c</m> by definition.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show that <m>S</m> satisfies the two strict partial order axioms:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Nonreflexivity.</em> Consider any <m>a \in A</m>.
            Since <m>a = a</m> it follows that it is not true that
            <m>a \neq a</m> and hence not true that <m>aSa</m>.
            Thus <m>S</m> is nonreflexive since <m>a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Transitivity.</em> Suppose that <m>aSb</m> and <m>bSc</m>.
            Hence by definition <m>aPb</m> and <m>a \neq b</m>,
            and <m>bPc</m> and <m>b \neq c</m>.
            Then, by the transitivity property of the partial order axioms,
            which is property (iii), we have that <m>aPc</m>.
            Suppose for a moment that <m>a = c</m>.
            Then we would have <m>aPb</m> and <m>bPa</m>
            (since <m>bPc</m> and <m>c=a</m>).
            Then by partial order axiom (ii) we have that <m>a=b</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>a \neq b</m>.
            So it must be that <m>a \neq c</m>.
            Thus <m>aPc</m> and <m>a \neq c</m> so that <m>aSc</m>,
            which shows that <m>S</m> is transitive.

          Suppose that we wish to find a maximal simply ordered subset <m>B</m> of <m>A</m> that contains <m>x</m>.

        <p>
          First, it seems that, as defined above,
          <m>B</m> does not actually contain <m>x</m> itself!
          This is because it is not true that
          <m>x \prec x</m> by the nonreflexivity of the partial order <m>\prec</m>.
          We assume that this was an oversight,
          which is easily remedied by defining
          <md>
            <mrow>B' = \braces{y \in A \where \text{ either }  x \prec y \text{ or }  y \prec x}</mrow>
          </md>
          and <m>B = B' \cup \braces{x}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Example<nbsp/>1, a circular region in <m>\reals^2</m> is clearly
          <md>
            <mrow>C_{\vx_0,r} = \braces{\vx \in \reals^2 \where \abs{\vx - \vx_0} \lt  r} \,</mrow>
          </md>,
          where the point <m>\vx_0 \in \reals^2</m> is the center of the circle,
          <m>r \in \preals</m> is the radius,
          and <m>\abs{(x,y)} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</m> is the standard vector magnitude.
          Then the collection <m>\cA</m> is the set of all circular regions:
          <md>
            <mrow>\cA = \braces{C_{\vx_0,r} \where \vx_0 \in \reals^2 \text{ and }  r \in \preals} \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then let <m>\cC = \braces{C_{(0,0),r} \where r \in \preals}</m> be the set of circles centered at the origin,
          which is a maximal simply ordered subset according to the example
          (and this is not difficult to show).
          Arbitrarily choose <m>X = C_{(0,0),1}</m>,
          that is the circular region of radius 1 centered at the origin,
          so that clearly <m>X \in \cC</m>.
          Since the partial order in this is example is
          <q>is a proper subset of</q>, define
          <md>
            <mrow>\cB' = \braces{Y \in \cA \where Y \pss X \text{ or }  X \pss Y}</mrow>
          </md>
          and <m>\cB = \cB' \cup \braces{X}</m>.
          The question is then whether <m>\cB = \cC</m>.
          We claim that, for this example, this is not the case.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider the set <m>C_{(1,0),2}</m> and any
            <m>\vx \in X = C_{(0,0),1}</m> so that <m>\abs{\vx - (0,0)} \lt  1</m>.
            Then we have
            <md>
              <mrow>\abs{\vx - (1,0)} \leq \abs{\vx - (0,0)} + \abs{(0,0) - (1,0)} \lt  1 + \abs{(-1,0)} = 1 + 1 = 2\,</mrow>
            </md>,
            where we have utilized the ever-useful triangle inequality.
            Therefore <m>\vx \in C_{(1,0),2}</m> so that
            <m>X \ss C_{(1,0),2}</m> since <m>\vx</m> was arbitrary.
            However, clearly the point <m>(1,0) \in C_{(1,0),2}</m> but we have that
            <m>(1,0) \notin C_{(0,0),1} = X</m> since <m>\abs{(1,0) - (0,0)} = \abs{(1,0)} = 1 \geq 1</m>.
            This shows that <m>X \pss C_{(1,0),2}</m> so that by definition
            <m>C_{(1,0),2} \in \cB'</m> and therefore <m>C_{(1,0),2} \in \cB = \cB' \cup \braces{X}</m>.
            But clearly <m>C_{(1,0),2} \notin \cC</m> since it is not centered at the origin.
            This shows that <m>\cB \neq \cC</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Hence it would seem that this method of attempting to define a maximal simply ordered subset containing <m>X</m> has failed in this example.
          It is easy to come up with an analogous counterexample that shows the same result of the other example of a maximal simply ordered subset of circles tangent to the y-axis at the origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding Example<nbsp/>2, recall that the order <m>\prec</m> is defined by
          <md>
            <mrow>(x_0, y_0) \prec (x_1, y_1)</mrow>
          </md>
          if <m>y_0 = y_1</m> and <m>x_0 \lt  x_1</m> for
          <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> and <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> in <m>\reals^2</m>.
          It is then claimed
          (which is again easy to show)
          that maximal simply ordered subsets are horizontal lines in the plane,
          that is sets
          <md>
            <mrow>L_{y_0} = \braces{(x,y) \in \reals^2 \where y = y_0}</mrow>
          </md>
          for some <m>y_0 \in \reals</m>.
          So consider any such <m>y_0 \in \reals</m> and let <m>\vx = (0, y_0)</m>.
          Now define
          <md>
            <mrow>B' = \braces{\vy \in \reals^2 \where \vx \prec \vy \text{ or }  \vy \prec \vx}</mrow>
          </md>
          and <m>B = B' \cup \braces{\vx}</m>.
          In contrast to Example<nbsp/>1,
          we here claim that <m>B = L_{y_0}</m>,
          which is to say that <m>B</m> <em>does</em>
          define the maximal simply ordered subset.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any <m>(x,y) \in B = B' \cup \braces{\vx}</m> so that either
            <m>(x,y) \in B'</m> or <m>(x,y) = \vx</m>.
            Clearly if <m>(x,y) = \vx = (0, y_0)</m> then
            <m>(x,y) \in L_{y_0}</m> since <m>y = y_0</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>(x,y) \in B'</m> then
            <m>(x,y) \prec \vx</m> or <m>\vx \prec (x,y)</m>.
            In the former case we have that <m>(x,y) \prec \vx = (0, y_0)</m> so that,
            by definition <m>y = y_0</m> and <m>x \lt 0</m>.
            Clearly then <m>(x,y) = (x,y_0) \in L_{y_0}</m> by definition.
            In the latter case we also have <m>y = y_0</m>
            (though this time <m>0 \lt x</m>)
            so that again <m>(x,y) \in L_{y_0}</m>.
            Since <m>(x,y)</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>B \ss L_{y_0}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>(x,y) \in L_{y_0}</m> so that <m>y = y_0</m>.
            If <m>x = 0</m> then <m>(x,y) = (0, y_0) = \vx</m> so that obviously <m>(x,y) \in \braces{\vx}</m>.
            If <m>0 \lt x</m> then <m>(x,y) = (x, y_0) \prec (0, y_0) = \vx</m> so that <m>(x,y) \in B'</m>.
            Similarly, if <m>x \lt 0</m>,
            then <m>\vx = (0, y_0) \prec (x, y_0) = (x,y)</m> so that again <m>(x,y) \in B'</m>.
            Hence in all cases either <m>(x,y) \in B'</m> or
            <m>(x,y) \in \braces{\vx}</m> so that <m>(x,y) \in B' \cup \braces{\vx} = B</m>.
            This shows that <m>L_{y_0} \ss B</m> since again <m>(x,y)</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we have shown that <m>B = L_{y_0}</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          So it would seem that, in this example,
          this naive technique does work!

          Find all maximal simply ordered subsets.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First define
          <md>
            <mrow>A = \braces{(x,y) \in \reals^2 \where y = x^3} \,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We show that it is a maximal simply ordered subset of <m>\reals^2</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>A</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            Consider distinct <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> and <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> in <m>A</m> so that
            <m>y_0 = x_0^3</m> and <m>y_1 = x_1^3</m>.
            Since they are distinct,
            it has to be that <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m> or <m>y_0 \neq y_1</m>.
            The latter case actually implies the former since the function
            <m>f(x) = x^3</m> is a well-defined function.
            Hence we can assume that <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m>,
            from which we can also assume without loss of generality that <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m>.
            Since <m>f(x) = x^3</m> is also a monotonically increasing function
            (which is easy to show),
            it then follows that <m>y_0 = x_0^3 \lt x_1^3 = y_1</m>.
            Thus we have that <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m> and
            <m>y_0 \leq y_1</m> so that <m>(x_0, y_0) \prec (x_1, y_1)</m> by definition.
            Since <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> and <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> were arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\prec</m> is a simple order on <m>A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is maximal suppose that <m>B</m> is any proper superset of <m>A</m> so that there is an
            <m>(x,y) \in B</m> where <m>(x,y) \notin A</m>.
            Therefore clearly <m>y \neq x^3</m> by definition.
            Now let <m>z = x^3</m> so that
            <m>y \neq x^3 = z</m> but <m>(x,z) \in A</m>.
            Clearly it is not true that <m>x \lt x</m> so that it can neither be that
            <m>(x,y) \prec (x,z)</m> nor <m>(x,z) \prec (z,y)</m>.
            Hence <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x,z)</m> are incomparable in <m>\prec</m>.
            This shows that <m>B</m> is not simply ordered and thus that <m>A</m> is maximal since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary superset.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now redefine
          <md>
            <mrow>A = \braces{(x,y) \in \reals^2 \where y = 2} \,</mrow>
          </md>,
          which we also show is a maximal simply ordered subset of <m>\reals^2</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            To show that <m>A</m> is simply ordered consider distinct <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> and
            <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> in <m>A</m> so that <m>y_0 = y_1 = 2</m>.
            Since these points are distinct and
            <m>y_0 = y_2</m> is must be that <m>x_0 \neq x_1</m>,
            from which we can assume that
            <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m> without loss of generality.
            But then clearly it is true that <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m> and
            <m>y_0 \leq y_1</m> so that <m>(x_0, y_0) \prec (x_1, y_1)</m>.
            Since these points were arbitrary this shows that <m>A</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that it is maximal suppose that <m>B</m> is any proper superset of <m>A</m> so that there is an
            <m>(x,y) \in B</m> where <m>(x,y) \notin A</m>.
            It then follows that <m>y \neq 2</m> so that the point
            <m>(x, 2) \in A</m> but <m>(x,2) \neq (x,y)</m>.
            Clearly it can be that neither <m>(x,2) \prec (x,y)</m> nor
            <m>(x,y) \prec (x,2)</m> since it is not true that <m>x \lt x</m>.
            Hence <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x,2)</m> are incomparable in <m>\prec</m>.
            This shows that <m>B</m> is not simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary superset this shows that <m>A</m> is maximal.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          Now let
          <md>
            <mrow>A = \braces{(x,y) \in \reals^2 \where y = x^2}\,</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim that this subset is not simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> and therefore cannot be a maximal simply ordered subset.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider the clearly distinct points <m>(-1,1)</m> and <m>(0,0)</m>.
            Clearly since <m>0 = 0^2</m> and
            <m>1 = (-1)^2</m> these are both in <m>A</m>.
            However, since <m>1 > 0</m> it is not true that <m>-1 \lt 0</m> and <m>1 \leq 0</m>,
            and therefore it is not true that <m>(-1,1) \prec (0,0)</m>.
            Similarly since <m>0 \geq -1</m> it is not true that <m>0 \lt -1</m> and <m>0 \leq 1</m>,
            and therefore it is not true that <m>(0,0) \prec (-1,1)</m>.
            Hence the two distinct points are both in <m>A</m> but are not comparable.
            This suffices to show that <m>A</m> is not simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          We now claim that the maximal simply ordered subsets of
          <m>\reals^2</m> as ordered by <m>\prec</m> are exactly the collection of sets of the form
          <md>
            <mrow>A_f = \braces{(x,y) \in \reals^2 \where y = f(x)}</mrow>
          </md>
          for some function <m>f: (a,b) \to \reals</m>,
          where <m>(a,b)</m> is an open interval of <m>\reals</m>,
          noting that it could be that
          <m>a = -\infty</m> and/or <m>b = \infty</m>.
          The function <m>f</m> must also satisfy the following properties:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                It is non-decreasing.
                Recall that this means that <m>x \lt y</m> implies that
                <m>f(x) \leq f(y)</m> for any <m>x,y \in (a,b)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>b \lt \infty</m> then its image is unbounded above.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>a > -\infty</m> then its image is unbounded below.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let <m>\cA</m> be the collection of all these subsets and let <m>\cB</m> denote the set of all maximal simply ordered subsets.
          We show that <m>\cA = \cB</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            <m>(\ss)</m> First consider any <m>A_f \in \cA</m> so that
            <m>f : (a,b) \to \reals</m> with the properties above for some open interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
            To show that <m>A_f</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> consider any distinct <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> in <m>A_f</m> so that
            <m>y = f(x)</m> and <m>y' = f(x')</m>.
            Since these are distinct it follows that
            <m>x \neq x'</m> or <m>f(x) = y \neq y' = f(x')</m>.
            In the latter case it also follows that
            <m>x \neq x'</m> as well for otherwise <m>f</m> would not be a function.
            Hence we can, without loss of generality,
            assume that <m>x \lt x'</m>.
            Since <m>f</m> is non-decreasing it follows that also <m>y = f(x) \leq f(x') = y'</m>,
            and therefore by definition <m>(x,y) \prec (x',y')</m>.
            Since these elements of <m>A_f</m> were arbitrary,
            it follows that <m>A_f</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>A_f</m> is maximal consider any proper superset <m>A</m> of <m>A_f</m> so that there is an
            <m>(x,y) \in A</m> where <m>(x,y) \notin A_f</m>.
            There are a few possible ways in which <m>(x,y)</m> can fail to be an element of <m>A_f</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
            Then it must be that <m>y \neq f(x)</m> since <m>(x,y) \notin A_f</m>.
            Since it is not true that <m>x \lt x</m>,
            it has to be that neither <m>(x,y) \prec (x,f(x))</m> nor <m>(x,f(x)), (x,y)</m>.
            Hence <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x,f(x))</m> are incomparable elements of <m>A</m> (noting that clearly
            <m>(x,(f(x)) \in A_f \ss A</m>) so that <m>A</m> is not simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \geq b</m>.
            Note that this is only possible if
            <m>b \lt \infty</m> so that <m>b \in \reals</m>.
            Thus in this case we have that the image of <m>f</m> is unbounded above by property
            (ii).
            Hence there is a <m>y_u \in reals</m> where <m>y'> y</m> and <m>y'</m> is in the image of <m>f</m>.
            Thus there is also an <m>x' \in (a,b)</m> where
            <m>y = f(x')</m> so that <m>(x',y') \in A_f \ss A</m>.
            Now, we have <m>x' \lt b \leq x</m> but <m>y'> y</m> so that it is not true that <m>y' \leq y</m>,
            and hence it cannot be that <m>(x',y') \prec (x,y)</m>.
            Similarly is it is clearly not true that
            <m>x \lt x'</m> so that it cannot be that <m>(x,y) \prec (x',y')</m> either.
            This shows that <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> are incomparable elements of <m>A</m> so that <m>A</m> is not simply ordered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x \leq a</m>.
            An argument analogous to the previous case shows that
            <m>a > -\infty</m> so that the image of <m>f</m> is unbounded below.
            From this it follows again that <m>A</m> is not simply ordered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in all cases <m>A</m> is not simply ordered so that <m>A_f</m> is a maximal simply ordered subset of
            <m>\reals^2</m> since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary proper superset.
            This shows that <m>A_f \in \cB</m> so that
            <m>\cA \ss \cB</m> since <m>A_f</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>(\sps)</m> Now consider any
            <m>B \in \cB</m> so that <m>B</m> is a maximal simply ordered set by <m>\prec</m>.
            Define
            <md>
              <mrow>X = \braces{x \in \reals \where (x,y) \in B \text{ for some }  y \in \reals} \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We prove that <m>B</m> has the following properties: \begin{enumerate} To show show (1) consider <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> and
            <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> in <m>B</m> and suppose that
            <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m>. \end{enumerate} Since <m>B</m> is simply ordered,
            it must be that either <m>(x_0,y_0) \prec (x_1,y_1)</m> or <m>(x_1,y_1) \prec (x_0,y_0)</m>.
            Since <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m> it clearly must be that
            <m>(x_0,y_0) \prec (x_1,y_1)</m> and hence also <m>y_0 \leq y_1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show (2) consider any <m>x \in X</m>.
            Clearly there is a <m>y \in \reals</m> where
            <m>(x,y) \in B</m> by the definition of <m>X</m>.
            To show that this <m>y</m> is unique,
            suppose that <m>(x,y_0)</m> and <m>(x,y_1)</m> are both in <m>B</m> but that
            <m>y_0 \neq y_1</m> so that <m>(x,y_0)</m> and <m>(x,y_1)</m> are distinct.
            Since <m>B</m> is simply ordered they must be comparable in <m>\prec</m> but they clearly cannot be since it is not true that <m>x \lt x</m>.
            As this is a contradiction, it must be that <m>y_0 = y_1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that out of the way,
            let <m>b</m> be the least upper bound of <m>X</m> if it is bounded above and <m>b = \infty</m> otherwise.
            Similarly let <m>a</m> be the greatest lower bound if <m>X</m> is bounded below and <m>a = -\infty</m> otherwise.
            Now we claim that <m>X</m> is equal to the open interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So consider any <m>x \in X</m> so that then clearly
            <m>a \leq x \leq b</m> since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are lower and upper bounds of <m>X</m>,
            respectively.
            Clearly if <m>b = \infty</m> then it cannot be that <m>x = b</m>
            (since <m>x \in \reals</m>)
            so assume that <m>b \in \reals</m> and <m>x = b</m>.
            Then <m>b = x \in X</m> so that by property (2) there is a unique
            <m>y \in \reals</m> where <m>(b,y) \in B</m>.
            Clearly then <m>(b+1,y) \notin B</m>,
            since <m>b+1 \notin X</m>,
            so that the set <m>B' = B \cup \braces{(b+1,y)}</m> is a proper superset of <m>B</m>.
            Now consider any <m>(x',y') \in B</m> so that clearly
            <m>x' \in X</m> and hence <m>x' \leq b \lt b+1</m>.
            By property (1) above it also follows that <m>y' \leq y</m>,
            and so we have that <m>(x',y') \prec (b+1, y)</m>.
            Since <m>(x',y')</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>(b+1,y)</m> is comparable to every element of <m>B</m> and hence <m>B'</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            But this is not possible since <m>B</m> is maximal and <m>B'</m> is a proper superset.
            Hence it must be that <m>x \neq b</m>.
            An analogous argument shows that
            <m>x \neq a</m> as well and hence <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>X \ss (a,b)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x \in (a,b)</m> so that <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>.
            Since <m>b</m> is the least upper bound of <m>X</m>,
            it has to be that <m>x</m> is not an upper of <m>X</m> so that there is an
            <m>x_g \in X</m> where <m>x \lt x_g \lt b</m>
            (clearly the existence of <m>x_g</m> also follows when
            <m>b = \infty</m> since then <m>X</m> is unbounded above).
            Clearly then there is also a
            <m>y_g \in \reals</m> where <m>(x_g,y_g) \in B</m>.
            It then follows that the set <m>Y_g = \braces{y \in \reals \where (z,y) \in B \text{ for some } x \lt z \lt b}</m> is nonempty.
            By an analogous argument there is an <m>(x_l,y_l) \in B</m> where
            <m>a \lt x_l \lt x</m> so that the set <m>Y_l = \braces{y \in \reals \where (z,y) \in B \text{ for some } a \lt z \lt x}</m> is nonempty.
            Now, for any <m>y \in Y_g</m>,
            we have that <m>(z, y) \in B</m> for some <m>x \lt z \lt b</m>.
            Therefore <m>x_l \lt x \lt z</m> and by property (1) of <m>B</m> we have that <m>y_l \leq y</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>y_l</m> is a lower bound of <m>Y_g</m> and hence it has a greatest lower bound <m>y_v</m>.
            So suppose that <m>x \notin X</m> so that there is not a
            <m>y \in \reals</m> where <m>(x,y) \in B</m>.
            Then we have that the set <m>B \cup \braces{(x,y_v)}</m> is a proper superset of <m>B</m>.
            However, consider any <m>(x',y') \in B</m> so that
            <m>x' \in X</m> but <m>x' \neq x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x' \lt x</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>a \lt x' \lt x</m> so that <m>y' \in Y_l</m>.
            Then, for any <m>y \in Y_g</m> we again have that
            <m>(z,y) \in B</m> for some <m>x \lt z \lt b</m>.
            Hence <m>x' \lt x \lt z</m> so that
            <m>y' \leq y</m> by property (1) since
            <m>(x',y') \in B</m> and <m>(z,y) \in B</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>y'</m> is a lower bound of <m>Y_g</m>.
            Since <m>y_v</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>Y_g</m>,
            we have that <m>y' \leq y_v</m>.
            Then clearly <m>(x',y') \prec (x, y_v)</m> since also <m>x' \lt x</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>x'> x</m>.
            Then it has to be that <m>x \lt x' \lt b</m> so that <m>y' \in Y_g</m>.
            It then follows that <m>y_v \leq y'</m> since <m>y_v</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>Y_g</m>.
            Hence we have that <m>(x,y_v) \prec (x',y')</m> since <m>x \lt x'</m> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore in all cases we have that <m>(x,y_v)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m>.
            Since <m>(x',y')</m> was arbitrary,
            this clearly shows that <m>B \cup \braces{(x,y_v)}</m> is simply ordered.
            But this cannot be possible since it is a proper superset and <m>B</m> is maximal!
            So it has to be that in fact there <em>is</em>
            a <m>y \in \reals</m> where
            <m>(x,y) \in B</m>, and hence <m>x \in X</m>.
            Since <m>x \in (a,b)</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>(a,b) \ss X</m>.
            This completes the rather long proof that <m>X = (a,b)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, by property (2) there is a unique <m>y \in \reals</m> for every
            <m>x \in X = (a,b)</m> where <m>(x,y) \in B</m>.
            So we define a function <m>f: (a,b) \to \reals</m> by simply setting <m>f(x) = y</m>.
            Clearly based on the way this function is defined and the fact that
            <m>(a,b) = X</m> we have that <m>B = A_f</m>.
            We must now show that <m>f</m> has the properties (i) through (iii) above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Property (i) follows almost immediately from property (1) of <m>B</m>.
            To see this,
            consider any <m>x,y \in (a,b)</m> where <m>x \lt y</m>.
            Then <m>(x,f(x))</m> and <m>(y,f(y))</m> are in <m>B</m> and hence <m>f(x) \leq f(y)</m> by property (1).
            For property (ii) suppose that
            <m>b \lt \infty</m> but that the image of <m>f</m> is bounded above.
            Hence it image has an upper bound,
            say <m>y_u \in \reals</m>,
            so that clearly <m>B \cup \braces{(b+1,y_u)}</m> is a proper superset of <m>B</m>.
            So consider any <m>(x,y) \in B</m> so that
            <m>y = f(x)</m> for some <m>x \in (a,b)</m>.
            Then clearly <m>f(x)</m> is in the image of <m>f</m> so that
            <m>y = f(x) \leq y_u</m> since <m>y_u</m> is an upper bound of the image.
            Since also we must have <m>x \lt b \lt b+1</m>,
            it follows that <m>(x,y) \prec (b+1, y_u)</m>.
            Since <m>(x,y) \in B</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>B \cup \braces{(b+1,y_u)}</m> is simply ordered,
            which cannot be possible since it is a proper superset and <m>B</m> is maximal.
            So it has to be that in fact the image of <m>f</m> is unbounded above when
            <m>b \lt \infty</m>, which shows property
            (ii).
            An analogous argument shows property
            (iii).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>f</m> has all of the required properties and <m>B = A_f</m>,
            this shows that <m>B \in \cA</m>.
            Clearly then <m>\cB \ss \cA</m> since <m>B</m> was arbitrary.
            This shows that <m>\cA = \cB</m> as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>

          Lastly, note that the example curves <m>y = x^3</m> and <m>y=2</m> are clearly in
          <m>\cA = \cB</m> since they are non-decreasing functions on <m>\reals</m>, (<m>\reals</m> being the same as the open interval <m>(-\infty, \infty)</m>),
          while the curve <m>y = x^2</m> is not since it is decreasing when <m>x \lt 0</m>.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>\cA</m> is a collection of sets of finite type.
            Let <m>\cB</m> be a subcollection of <m>\cA</m> that is simply ordered by <m>\pss</m>.
            Consider next any finite subset <m>B</m> of <m>\bigcup \cB</m>.
            Then, for every <m>b \in B</m>,
            <m>b \in \bigcup \cB</m> so that we can choose a set
            <m>B_b \in \cB</m> such that <m>b \in B_b</m>.
            Note that this does not require the choice axiom since we need to make only a finite number of choices.
            Then the set <m>\cB' = \braces{B_b \where b \in B}</m> is clearly a finite set of elements of <m>\cB</m>.
            Since <m>\cB</m> is simply ordered by <m>\pss</m>,
            it follows that <m>\cB'</m> is as well and so has a largest element <m>C</m> since it is finite.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, for any <m>b \in B</m>,
            we have that <m>b \in B_b \ss C</m> so that <m>b \in C</m>,
            and so <m>B</m> is a finite subset of <m>C</m>.
            Since <m>C \in \cB</m> and
            <m>\cB \ss \cA</m>, clearly <m>C \in \cA</m>.
            Since <m>\cA</m> is of finite type and <m>B</m> is a finite subset of <m>C</m>,
            it follows that <m>B \in \cA</m> also.
            Since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary finite subset of <m>\bigcup \cB</m>,
            it then follows that <m>\bigcup \cB</m> is also in <m>\cA</m> since it is of finite type.
            It then follows from the Kuratowski lemma (Exercise<nbsp/>11.5) that <m>\cA</m> has an element that is properly contained in no other element of <m>\cA</m> as desired.

            We show that <m>\cA</m> has finite type,

          <p>
            <m>(\imp)</m> Suppose that <m>B \ss A</m> is in <m>\cA</m> so that it is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            Clearly any finite subset of <m>B</m> is also simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> so that it is also in <m>\cA</m>,

            Clearly then the set <m>\braces{x,y}</m> is a finite subset of <m>B</m> and hence is in <m>\cA</m>.
            Then this means that <m>\braces{x,y}</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> so that clearly <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable.
            Since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary this shows that <m>B</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> and hence <m>B \in \cA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have thus shown that <m>\cA</m> is of finite type so that it has a set <m>C</m> such that is properly contained in no other element of <m>\cA</m>.
            Since <m>C \in \cA</m>, it is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            It is also maximal since,
            if <m>D</m> is any proper superset of <m>C</m> then it cannot be that <m>D</m> is simply ordered for then we would have <m>D \in \cA</m> and <m>C \pss D</m>,
            which would contradict the definition of <m>C</m>.
            Hence <m>C</m> is the maximal simply ordered subset of <m>A</m> that shows the maximum principle.

          A typical use of Zorn's lemma in algebra is the proof that every vector space has a basis.
          Recall that if <m>A</m> is a subset of the vector space <m>V</m>,
          we say a vector belongs to that <em>span</em>
          of <m>A</m> if it equals a finite linear combination of elements of <m>A</m>.
          The set <m>A</m> is <em>independent</em>
          if the only finite linear combination of elements of <m>A</m> that equals the zero vector is the trivial one having all coefficients zero.
          If <m>A</m> is independent and if every vector in <m>V</m> belongs to the span of <m>A</m>,

            We show this by contradiction.
            Suppose that <m>A</m> is independent and <m>v \in V</m> does not belong to the span of <m>A</m>.
            Also let <m>B = A \cup \braces{v}</m> and suppose that <m>B</m> is
            <em>not</em> independent.
            Then

            for some nonzero coefficients <m>\b_i</m>,
            where each <m>b_i</m> is in <m>B</m>.
            Now, it must be that one of the <m>b_i</m> vectors is <m>v</m> and the rest in <m>A</m> since otherwise they would all be in <m>A</m> and then <m>A</m> would not be independent.
            Hence this can be expressed as
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \a_i a_i + \g v = 0</mrow>
            </md>
            for nonzero coefficients <m>\a_i</m> and <m>\g</m> and vectors <m>a_i \in A</m>.
            However clearly then we would have
            <md>
              <mrow>v = -\frac{1}{\g} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \a_1 a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \parens{\frac{-\a_i}{\g}} a_i</mrow>
            </md>
            so that <m>v</m> is a linear combination of vectors in <m>A</m> and hence is in the span of <m>A</m>.
            This is a contradiction so that it must be that in fact
            <m>B = A \cup \braces{v}</m> is independent as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\cA</m> be the collection of all independent sets in <m>V</m>.
            We know that <m>\pss</m> is a strict partial order on <m>\cA</m>.
            Now let <m>\cB</m> be any subset of <m>\cA</m> that is simply ordered by <m>\pss</m>.
            We claim that <m>\bigcup \cB</m> is an upper bound of <m>\cB</m> that is in <m>\cA</m>.
            So first consider any <m>B \in \cB</m> and any <m>b \in B</m> so that clearly then <m>b \in \bigcup \cB</m>.
            Hence <m>B \ss \bigcup \cB</m> since <m>b</m> was arbitrary.
            Since <m>B \in \cB</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>\bigcup \cB</m> is an upper bound of <m>\cB</m> by <m>\pss</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that <m>\bigcup \cB</m> is also in <m>\cA</m>.
            To this end consider any finite set <m>B</m> of elements of
            <m>\bigcup \cB</m> so that <m>B</m> is a set of vectors in <m>V</m>.
            Now, for each <m>b \in B</m> we have that
            <m>b \in \bigcup \cB</m> so that we can choose any set
            <m>B_b \in \cB</m> where <m>b \in B_b</m>.
            Note that this does not require the axiom of choice since <m>B</m> is finite.
            Then, since each <m>B_b</m> is in <m>\cB</m>,
            which is simply ordered by <m>\pss</m> and <m>\braces{B_b \where b \in B}</m> is finite,
            it follows that it has a largest element <m>C</m> so that
            <m>B_b \ss C</m> for any <m>b \in B</m>.
            Hence <m>B \ss C</m> since each
            <m>b \in B_b</m> and <m>B_b \ss C</m>.
            Also <m>C \in \cA</m> since <m>C \in \cB</m> and
            <m>\cB \ss \cA</m> so that <m>C</m> is independent.
            Hence the only linear combination of the vectors in <m>B</m> that is the zero vector must have all zero coefficients since they are all in the independent set <m>C</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was an arbitrary set of vectors in <m>\bigcup \cB</m>,
            this shows that <m>\bigcup \cB</m> is independent and therefore in <m>\cA</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>\cB</m> was an arbitrary simply ordered subset of <m>\cA</m>,
            it follows that every such subset has an upper bound in <m>\cA</m>.
            Thus by Zorn's Lemma <m>\cA</m> has a maximal element as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Again let <m>\cA</m> be the collection of all independent sets in <m>V</m>,
            which we know has a maximal element <m>A</m> from part<nbsp/>(b).
            We claim that <m>A</m> is a basis for <m>V</m>.
            Suppose to the contrary that it is not so that,
            since we know that <m>A</m> is independent
            (since it is in <m>\cA</m>),
            there must be a vector <m>v \in V</m> that is not in the span of <m>A</m>.
            Then by part<nbsp/>(a) we have that
            <m>A \cup \braces{v}</m> is also independent and so in <m>\cA</m>.
            We also have that <m>v \notin A</m> since otherwise it would clearly be in the span of <m>A</m>.
            Hence <m>A \pss A \cup \braces{v}</m>.
            However, this contradicts the fact that <m>A</m> is a maximal element of <m>\cA</m>,
            so that it must be that in fact <m>A</m> is a basis for <m>V</m> as desired.

        <lemma xml:id="lem_sewo_hunique">

            <p>
              If <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> map sections of <m>J</m>, or all of <m>J</m>,
              into <m>C</m> and satisfy <m>(*)</m> for all <m>x</m> in their respective domains,
              then <m>h(x) = k(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in both domains.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that the domains of <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are sets <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> where each is either a section of <m>J</m> or <m>J</m> itself.
            Since this is the case,
            we can assume without loss of generality that <m>H \ss K</m> and so <m>H</m> is exactly the domain common to both <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>.
            Now suppose that the hypothesis we are trying to prove is <em>not</em>
            true so that there is an <m>x</m> in both domains (i.e.
            <m>x \in H</m>) where <m>h(x) \neq k(x)</m>.
            We can also assume that <m>x</m> is the smallest such element since <m>H \ss J</m> and <m>J</m> is well-ordered.
            It then clearly follows that
            <m>S_x \ss H</m> is a section of <m>J</m> and that
            <m>h(y) = k(y)</m> for all <m>y \in S_x</m>.
            From this we clearly have that <m>h \rest S_x = k \rest S_x</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = \r(h \rest S_x) = \r(k \rest S_x) = k(x)</mrow>
            </md>
            since both <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> satisfy <m>(*)</m> and <m>x</m> is in the domain of both.
            This contradicts the supposition that
            <m>h(x) \neq k(x)</m> so that it must be that no such <m>x</m> exists and hence <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are the same in their common domain as desired.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <lemma xml:id="lem_sewo_hsucc">
          <statement>
            <p>
              If there exists a function
              <m>h: S_\a \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m>,
              then there exists a function
              <m>k : S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>h : S_\a \to C</m> is such a function satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
            Now let <m>\bar{S}_\a = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> and we define <m>k : \bar{S}_\a \to C</m> as follows.
            For any <m>x \in \bar{S}_\a</m> set
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = \begin{cases}h(x) \amp  x \in S_\a \\ \r(h) \amp  x = \a \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            We note that clearly <m>S_\a</m> and
            <m>\braces{\a}</m> are disjoint so that this is unambiguous.
            We also note that <m>h</m> is a function from a section of <m>J</m> to <m>C</m> so that <m>h \in \cF</m> and
            <m>\r(h) \in C</m> is therefore defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>k</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            First, clearly <m>h \rest S_x = k \rest S_x</m> for any <m>x \leq \a</m> since
            <m>k(y) = h(y)</m> by definition for any <m>y \in S_x \ss S_\a</m>.
            Now consider any <m>x \in \bar{S}_\a</m>.
            If <m>x = \a</m> then by definition we have
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = \r(h) = \r(h \rest S_\a) = \r(k \rest S_\a) = \r(k \rest S_x)</mrow>
            </md>
            since clearly <m>h = h \rest S_\a</m> since <m>S_\a</m> is the domain of <m>h</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>x \in S_\a</m> then <m>x \lt  \a</m> so that
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = h(x) = \r(h \rest S_x) = \r(k \rest S_x)</mrow>
            </md>
            since <m>h</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Therefore, since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>k</m> also satisfies <m>(*)</m>.

              <mrow>k = \bigcup_{\a \in K} h_\a \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which we claim is the function we seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that <m>k</m> is actually a function from <m>\bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m> to <m>C</m>.
            So consider any <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>k</m>.
            Suppose that <m>(x, a)</m> and <m>(x, b)</m> are both in <m>k</m> so that there are <m>\a</m> and <m>\b</m> in <m>K</m> where
            <m>(x, a) \in h_\a</m> and <m>(x, b) \in h_\b</m>.
            Since <m>h_\a</m> and <m>h_\b</m> both satisfy <m>(*)</m>,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_sewo_hunique">Lemma</xref>
            that <m>a = h_\a(x) = h_\b(x) = b</m> since clearly <m>x</m> is in the domain of both.
            This shows that <m>k</m> is indeed a function since <m>(x,a)</m> and <m>(x,b)</m> were arbitrary.
            Also clearly the domain of <m>k</m> is <m>\bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m> since,
            for any <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m>,
            we have that there is an <m>\a \in K</m> where <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Hence <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>h_\a</m> and so in the domain of <m>k</m>.
            In the other direction,
            clearly if <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>k</m> then it is in the domain of <m>h_\a</m> for some <m>\a \in K</m>.
            Since this domain is <m>S_\a</m>,
            clearly <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m>.
            Lastly, obviously the range of <m>k</m> can be <m>C</m> since this is the range of every <m>h_\a</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>k</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in K} S_\a</m> so that
            <m>x \in S_\a</m> for some <m>\a \in K</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>k(y) = h_\a(y)</m> for every
            <m>y \in S_\a</m> since <m>h_\a \ss k</m>.
            It then immediately follows that <m>k(x) = h(x)</m> and
            <m>k \rest S_x = h_\a \rest S_x</m> since <m>S_x \ss S_\a</m>.
            Then, since <m>h_\a</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>k(x) = h_\a(x) = \r(h_\a \rest S_x) = \r(k \rest S_x) \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that <m>k</m> satisfies <m>(*)</m> as desired.

        <lemma xml:id="lem_sewo_hind">

            <p>
              For every <m>\b \in J</m>,
              there exists a function <m>h_\b : S_\b \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
          <p>
            We show this by transfinite induction.
            So consider any <m>\b \in J</m> and suppose that,
            for every <m>x \in S_\b</m>,
            there is a function <m>h_x : S_x \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m>.
            Now, if <m>\b</m> has an immediate predecessor <m>\a</m> then we claim that <m>S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            First if <m>x \in S_\b</m> then <m>x \lt \b</m> so that
            <m>x \leq \a</m> since <m>\a</m> is the immediate predecessor of <m>\b</m>.
            If <m>x \lt \a</m> then <m>x \in S_\a</m> and if <m>x = \a</m> then <m>x \in \braces{\a}</m>.
            Hence in either case we have that <m>x \in S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            If <m>x \in S_\a</m> then <m>x \lt \a \lt \b</m> so that <m>s \in S_\b</m>.
            On the other hand if <m>x \in \braces{\a}</m> then
            <m>x = \a \lt \b</m> so that again <m>x \in S_\b</m>.
            Thus we have shown that <m>S_\b \ss S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m> and
            <m>S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \ss S_\b</m> so that <m>S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            Since <m>\a \in S_\b</m> it follows that there is an
            <m>h_\a : S_\a \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Then, by <xref ref="lem_sewo_hsucc">Lemma</xref>,
            we have that there is an <m>h_\b : S_\b = S_\a \cup \braces{\a} \to C</m> that also satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>\b</m> does not have an immediate predecessor then we claim that <m>S_\b = \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in S_\b</m> so that <m>x \lt \b</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> cannot be the immediate predecessor of <m>\b</m>,
            there must be an <m>\a</m> where <m>x \lt \a \lt \b</m>.
            Then <m>x \in S_\a</m> so that,
            since <m>\a \lt \b</m>, clearly <m>x \in \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m>.
            Now suppose that <m>x \in \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m> so that there is an
            <m>\a \lt \b</m> where <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Then clearly <m>x \lt \a \lt \b</m> so that also <m>x \in S_\b</m>.
            Thus we have shown that <m>S_\b \ss \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m> and
            <m>\bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g \ss S_\b</m> so that <m>S_\b = \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g</m>.
            Now, clearly <m>S_\b</m> is a subset of <m>J</m> where there is an
            <m>h_x : S_x \to C</m> satisfying <m>(*)</m> for every <m>x \in S_\b</m>.
            Then it follows from <xref ref="lem_sewo_hunion">Lemma</xref>
            that there is a function <m>h_\b</m> from
            <m>\bigcup_{\g \lt S_\b} S_\g = \bigcup_{\g \lt \b} S_\g = S_\b</m> to <m>C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, in either case,
            we have shown that there is an
            <m>h_\b : S_\b \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            The desired result then follows by transfinite induction.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>J</m> has no largest element.
            Then we claim that <m>J = \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>.
            For any <m>x \in J</m> there must be a <m>y \in J</m> where <m>x \lt y</m> since <m>x</m> cannot be the largest element of <m>J</m>.
            Hence <m>x \in S_y</m> so that also clearly <m>\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>.
            Then, for any <m>x \in \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>,
            there is an <m>\a \in J</m> where <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Clearly <m>S_\a \ss J</m> so that <m>x \in J</m> also.
            Hence <m>J \ss \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m> and
            <m>\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a \ss J</m> so that <m>J = \bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a</m>.
            Since we know from <xref ref="lem_sewo_hind">Lemma</xref>
            that there is an <m>h_\a : S_\a \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m> for every <m>\a \in J</m>,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_sewo_hunion">Lemma</xref>
            that there is a function <m>h</m> from
            <m>\bigcup_{\a \in J} S_\a = J</m> to <m>C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>J</m> does have a largest element <m>\b</m> then clearly <m>J = S_\b \cup \braces{\b}</m>.
            Since we know that there is an
            <m>h_\b : S_\b \to C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m> by <xref ref="lem_sewo_hind">Lemma</xref>,
            it follows from <xref ref="lem_sewo_hsucc">Lemma</xref>
            that there is a function <m>h</m> from
            <m>S_\b \cup \braces{\b} = J</m> to <m>C</m> that satisfies <m>(*)</m>.
            Hence the desired function <m>h</m> exists in both cases.
            <xref ref="lem_sewo_hunique">Lemma</xref>
            also clearly shows that this function is unique.

          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, for any <m>\a \in J</m> and <m>\b \in E</m>,
            let <m>S_\a</m> denote the section of <m>J</m> by <m>\a</m>,
            and <m>T_\b</m> denote the section of <m>E</m> by <m>\b</m>.
            To avoid ambiguity,
            also suppose that <m>\lt</m> is the well-order on <m>J</m> and <m>\prec</m> is the well-order on <m>E</m>.
            We show that each of these conditions are equivalent to the condition that
            <m>h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}</m> for every <m>\a \in J</m>.
            Call this condition
            (iii).
            This of course also shows that the conditions are equivalent to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that (i) implies
            (iii).
            So suppose that <m>h</m> is order preserving and its image is <m>E</m> or a section of <m>E</m>.
            Consider any <m>\a \in J</m> and any <m>y \in h(S_\a)</m> so that there is an
            <m>x \in S_\a</m> where <m>y = h(x)</m>.
            Then <m>x \lt \a</m> and <m>y = h(x) \prec h(\a)</m> since <m>h</m> preserves order.
            Therefore <m>y \in T_{h(\a)}</m> so that
            <m>h(S_\a) \ss T_{h(\a)}</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Now consider <m>y \in T_{h(\a)}</m> so that <m>y \prec h(\a)</m>.
            Since also clearly <m>y \in E</m> (since <m>T_{h(\a)} \ss E</m>),
            <m>y</m> is in the image of <m>h</m> if its image is all of <m>E</m>.
            If the image of <m>h</m> is some section of <m>E</m>, say <m>T_\b</m>,
            then clearly <m>h(\a) \in T_\b</m> since <m>h(\a)</m> is obviously in the image of <m>h</m>.
            Hence we have <m>y \prec h(\a) \prec \b</m> so that
            <m>y \in T_\b</m> and hence in the image of <m>h</m>.
            Since <m>y</m> is in the image of <m>h</m> in either case,
            there is an <m>x \in J</m> such that <m>y = h(x)</m>.
            Then <m>h(x) = y \prec h(\a)</m> so that
            <m>x \lt \a</m> since <m>h</m> preserves order.
            Hence <m>x \in S_\a</m> so that
            <m>y \in h(S_\a)</m> since <m>y = h(x)</m>.
            This shows that <m>T_{h(\a)} \ss h(S_\a)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Therefore <m>h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}</m> so that condition (iii) is true since <m>\a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show that (iii) implies (i).
            So suppose that <m>h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}</m> for all <m>\a \in J</m>.
            First, it is easy to see that <m>h</m> preserves order since,
            if <m>x,y \in J</m> where <m>x \lt y</m>,
            then we have that <m>x \in S_y</m> so that clearly <m>h(x) \in h(S_y) = T_{h(y)}</m>,
            and hence <m>h(x) \lt h(y)</m>.
            To show that the image of <m>h</m>, i.e.
            <m>h(J)</m>, is either <m>E</m> or a section of <m>E</m>,
            consider the set <m>E - h(J)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>E - h(J) = \es</m>.
            Then clearly for any <m>y \in E</m> we must have that
            <m>y \in h(J)</m> since otherwise it would be that <m>y \in E - h(J)</m>.
            Thus <m>E \ss h(J)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Also clearly <m>h(J) \ss E</m> since <m>E</m> is the range of <m>h</m>.
            This shows that <m>h(J) = E</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>E - h(J) \neq \es</m>.
            Then clearly <m>E - h(J)</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>E</m> so that it has a smallest element <m>\b</m> since <m>E</m> is well-ordered,
            noting that clearly <m>\b \notin h(J)</m>.
            We claim that <m>h(J) = T_\b</m>.
            So consider any <m>y \in h(J)</m> so that there is an <m>x \in J</m> where <m>y = h(x)</m>.
            Suppose for a moment that <m>\b \eprec y</m>.
            Now it cannot be that <m>\b = y</m> since <m>y \in h(J)</m> but
            <m>\b \notin h(J)</m>, and so <m>\b \prec y</m>.
            But then <m>\b \in T_y = T_{h(x)} = h(S_x)</m> since <m>x \in J</m>.
            Then <m>\b</m> is in the image of <m>h</m> since clearly <m>h(S_x) \ss h(J)</m>.
            As this contradicts the fact that <m>\b \notin h(J)</m>,
            it must be that <m>y \prec \b</m> so that <m>y \in T_\b</m>.
            This shows that <m>h(J) \ss T_\b</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Suppose now that <m>y \in T_\b</m> so that <m>y \prec \b</m>.
            Since <m>\b</m> is the smallest element of <m>E - h(J)</m>,
            it follows that <m>y \notin E - h(J)</m>.
            Since clearly <m>y \in E</m>
            (since <m>T_\b \ss E</m>),
            it must be that <m>y \in h(J)</m>.
            This shows that <m>T_\b \ss h(J)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Hence we have shown that <m>h(J) = T_\b</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore in every case either the image of <m>h</m> is <m>E</m> or a section of <m>E</m> as desired.
            This completes the proof of (i).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that (ii) implies
            (iii).
            So suppose that <m>h(\a)</m> is the smallest element of
            <m>E - h(S_\a)</m> for every <m>\a \in J</m>.
            First we show that <m>h</m> is injective.
            So consider any <m>x,y \in J</m> where <m>x \neq y</m>.
            We can assume without loss of generality that <m>x \lt y</m> so that
            <m>x \in S_y</m> and hence <m>h(x) \in h(S_y)</m>.
            However since we have that <m>h(y)</m> is the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_y)</m>,
            clearly <m>h(y) \notin h(S_y)</m>.
            Therefore we have that <m>h(x) \neq h(y)</m> so that <m>h</m> is injective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>\a \in J</m> so that clearly <m>h(\a)</m> is the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_\a)</m>.
            Suppose that <m>y \in h(S_\a)</m> so that there is an
            <m>x \in S_\a</m> where <m>y = h(x)</m>,
            and therefore <m>x \lt \a</m>.
            Consider the possibility that <m>h(\a) \prece h(x) = y</m>.
            It cannot be that <m>h(\a) = h(x) = y</m> since
            <m>x \neq \a</m> and <m>h</m> is injective,
            so it must be that <m>h(\a) \prec h(x)</m>.
            It then follows that <m>h(\a) \notin E - h(S_x)</m> since <m>h(x)</m> is the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_x)</m>.
            Thus <m>h(\a) \in h(S_x)</m> since clearly <m>h(\a) \in E</m>.
            It then follows from the fact that <m>h</m> is injective that
            <m>\a \in S_x</m> so that we have <m>\a \lt x \lt \a</m>,
            which is clearly a contradiction.
            So it must be that <m>y = h(x) \prec h(\a)</m> so that <m>y \in T_{h(\a)}</m>.
            This shows that <m>h(S_\a) \ss T_{h(\a)}</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>y \in T_{h(\a)}</m> so that <m>y \prec h(\a)</m>.
            Since <m>h(\a)</m> is the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_\a)</m>,
            it follows that <m>y \notin E - h(S_\a)</m>.
            Since clearly <m>y \in E</m>,
            it must be that <m>y \in h(S_\a)</m>.
            This shows that <m>T_{h(\a)} \ss h(S_\a)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary,
            and hence <m>h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}</m>,
            which shows (iii) since <m>\a</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, we show that (iii) implies
            (ii).
            So suppose that <m>h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}</m> for every
            <m>\a \in J</m> and consider any such <m>\a</m>.
            Clearly we have that <m>h(\a) \in E</m> but
            <m>h(\a) \notin T_{h(\a)} = h(S_\a)</m> so that <m>h(\a) \in E - h(S_\a)</m>.
            Suppose for the moment that <m>h(\a)</m> is not the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_\a)</m> so that there is a
            <m>\b \in E - h(S_\a)</m> where <m>\b \prec h(\a)</m>.
            Then <m>\b \in T_{h(\a)}</m> so that it must be that
            <m>\b \notin E - T_{h(\a)} = E - h(S_\a)</m> since <m>h(S_\a) = T_{h(\a)}</m>.
            Clearly this is a contradiction so that it must be that <m>h(\a)</m> really is the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_\a)</m>,
            which shows (ii) since <m>\a</m> was arbitrary.

            (see <xref ref="lem_wellord_tind">Lemma</xref>).
            So consider <m>\a \in J</m> and assume that
            <m>h(x) \leq k(x)</m> for all <m>x \in S_\a</m>.
            Since <m>k</m> preserves order we have that
            <m>h(x) \leq k(x) \lt  k(\a)</m> when <m>x \lt  \a</m>.
            In particular, this means that <m>h(x) \neq k(\a)</m> for all
            <m>x \in S_\a</m> so that <m>k(\a) \in E - h(S_\a)</m>.
            Hence <m>E - h(S_\a)</m> is not empty so that <m>h(S_\a) \neq E</m>.
            Thus <m>h(\a)</m> is the smallest element of <m>E - h(S_\a)</m> and so
            <m>h(\a) \leq k(\a)</m> since <m>k(\a) \in E - h(S_\a)</m>.
            This completes the induction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, for any <m>\a \in J</m> and any <m>x \lt  \a</m> we have
            <m>h(x) \leq k(x) \lt  k(\a)</m> since <m>k</m> preserves order so that <m>h(x) \neq k(\a)</m>.
            As in the induction step above,
            it follows that <m>h(S_\a) \neq E</m>.
            Hence, since <m>\a</m> was arbitrary,
            <md>
              <mrow>h(\a) = \text{ smallest }  [E - h(S_\a)]</mrow>
            </md>
            for all <m>\a \in J</m>.
            It then follows from Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(a) that <m>h</m> is order preserving and maps <m>J</m> onto <m>E</m> or a section of <m>E</m>.
            This clearly shows that <m>J</m> has the order type of <m>E</m> or a section of <m>E</m> as desired.

                Show that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same order type.

      <solution>
        <p>
          (a)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, we can assume that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are disjoint since, if not,
            we can form <m>A' = \braces{(x,1) \where x \in A}</m> and <m>B' = \braces{(x,2) \where x \in B}</m>,
            which clearly <em>are</em> disjoint and have the same order types as <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> if ordered in the same way.
            So let <m>\prec</m> be the order on
            <m>A \cup B</m> as in Exercise<nbsp/>10.8 with all the elements of <m>A</m> before the elements of <m>B</m>.
            From the exercise, we know that
            <m>A \cup B</m> is well-ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            Now, clearly the identity function <m>i_B</m> with <m>A \cup B</m> as the range is an order-preserving function from <m>B</m> to
            <m>A \cup B</m> so that <m>B</m> is the same order type as <m>A \cup B</m> or a section of
            <m>A \cup B</m> by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>B</m> has the same order type as <m>A \cup B</m>,
            then there is a an order preserving bijection <m>g: A \cup B \to B</m>.
            Let <m>b</m> be the smallest element of <m>B</m> so that <m>y = g(b) \in B</m>.
            Since <m>b</m> is the smallest element of <m>B</m>,
            clearly the section <m>S_b = \braces{x \in A \cup B \where x \prec b} = A</m>.
            Also clearly <m>g(A) = g(S_b) = S_y = \braces{x \in B \where x \lt y}</m> so that <m>A</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>B</m> since <m>g</m> preserves order.
          </p>
          <p>
            If <m>B</m> has the same order type as a section of
            <m>A \cup B</m> then there is an order preserving bijection
            <m>f: B \to S_\a</m> for some <m>\a \in A \cup B</m>.
            If <m>\a \in A</m> then clearly <m>S_\a</m> lies entirely in <m>A</m> and is a section of <m>A</m> so that <m>B</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>A</m>.
            So now suppose that <m>\a \in B</m>.
            If <m>\a</m> is the smallest element of <m>B</m> then again it has to be that <m>S_\a</m> lies in <m>A</m> and is in fact the entirety of <m>A</m> so that <m>B</m> and <m>A</m> have the same order type.
            If <m>\a</m> is not the smallest element of <m>B</m> then <m>S_\a</m> contains elements of both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
            So let <m>b</m> be the smallest element of <m>B</m> so that <m>b \in S_\a</m>,
            and let <m>y \in B</m> be such that <m>f(y) = b</m>,
            which exists since <m>f</m> is surjective.
            We also have that <m>S_b = A</m> since <m>b</m> is the smallest element of <m>B</m>.
            It then follows that <m>f(S_y) = S_b = A</m> since
            <m>f(y) = b</m> so that <m>A</m> has the same order type as the section <m>S_y</m> of <m>B</m> since <m>f</m> preserves order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence in all cases one of the desired results always follows.
            To show that exactly one of these is the case,
            note that if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same order type then clearly it cannot be that <m>A</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>B</m> since then <m>B</m> would also have the same order type is its own section,
            which would violate Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(b).
            Similarly <m>B</m> cannot have the same order type as a section of <m>A</m> since then <m>A</m> would have the same order type as its own section.
            Now suppose that <m>A</m> has the same order type as a section <m>S_b</m> of <m>B</m>.
            Then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> cannot have the same order type since then <m>B</m> would have the same order type as its section <m>S_b</m>.
            Also <m>B</m> cannot have the same order type as a section <m>S_a</m> of <m>A</m> since then the section <m>S_b</m>,
            and therefore <m>A</m>,
            would have the same order type as a smaller section of <m>A</m>.
            An analogous argument shows the result when <m>B</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>A</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>A</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>B</m>.
            Then there would be a bijection from <m>A</m>,
            an uncountable set, to a section of <m>B</m>, which is countable.
            A similar contradiction arises if <m>B</m> were to have the same order type as a section of <m>A</m>.
            By part<nbsp/>(a),
            the only remaining possibility is that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> have the same order type as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            For any <m>(A,\lt ) \in \cA</m> we have that it is not equal to a section of itself since then it would then clearly have the same order type as its own section,
            which would violate Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(b).
            Hence it is not true that <m>(A, \lt ) \prec (A, \lt )</m> by definition,
            which shows that <m>\prec</m> is nonreflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider <m>(A,\lt )</m>, <m>(A',\lt ')</m>,
            and <m>(A'',\lt '')</m> in <m>\cA</m> where
            <m>(A,\lt ) \prec (A',\lt ')</m> and <m>(A',\lt ') \prec (A'',\lt '')</m>.
            Then <m>(A,\lt )</m> is a section of <m>(A',\lt ')</m>.
            Also <m>(A',\lt ')</m> is a section of
            <m>(A'',\lt '')</m> so that clearly any section of
            <m>(A',\lt ')</m> is also a section of <m>(A'',\lt '')</m>.
            Since <m>(A,\lt )</m> is such a section we have that <m>(A,\lt )</m> is a section of
            <m>(A'',\lt '')</m> so that <m>(A,\lt ) \prec (A'',\lt '')</m>.
            This shows that <m>\prec</m> is transitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the proof that <m>\prec</m> is a strict partial order.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (b)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First we must show that <m>B'</m> is simply ordered by <m>\lt '</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First consider any <m>(x,y) \in \lt '</m> so that there is a <m>(B,\lt ) \in \cB</m> where
            <m>(x,y) \in \lt</m> and <m>x,y \in B</m>.
            Clearly then <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in the union <m>B'</m> so that <m>(x,y) \in B' \times B'</m>.
            This shows that <m>\lt ' \ss B' \times B'</m> so that <m>\lt '</m> is a relation on <m>B'</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next consider any <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>B'</m> where <m>x \neq y</m>.
            Then there are well-ordered sets
            <m>(B_1, \lt _1)</m> and <m>(B_2, \lt _2)</m> in <m>\cB</m> where
            <m>x \in B_1</m> and <m>y \in B_2</m>.
            Since <m>\cB</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> we have that
            <m>(B_1, \lt _1) \prec (B_2, \lt _2)</m> or <m>(B_2, \lt _2) \prec (B_1, \lt _1)</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume the former case
            (since otherwise we can just swap the roles of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>).
            Then <m>(B_1 \lt _1)</m> is a section of
            <m>(B_2, \lt _2)</m> and is thus also a subset so that
            <m>x,y \in B_2</m>, It then follows that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable by <m>\lt _2</m> since
            <m>x \neq y</m> and <m>\lt _2</m> is a well-order and therefore a simple order.
            Thus <m>(x,y)</m> or <m>(y,x)</m> are in <m>\lt _2</m>.
            Since <m>\lt '</m> is the union of all relations <m>\lt</m> where <m>(B,\lt ) \in \cB</m>,
            clearly we have that <m>(x,y)</m> or <m>(y,x)</m> are in <m>\lt '</m> since <m>\lt _2</m> is such a relation.
            Thus shows that <m>\lt '</m> has the comparability property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any <m>x \in B'</m> so that there is a
            <m>(B,\lt ) \in \cB</m> where <m>x \in B</m>.
            Consider also any <m>(B'', \lt '') \in \cB</m>.
            Then, since <m>\cB</m> is simply ordered,
            it follows that <m>(B,\lt )</m> and
            <m>(B'', \lt '')</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m>.
            If <m>(B,\lt ) \prec (B'',\lt '')</m> then <m>(B,\lt )</m> is a section of
            <m>(B'',\lt '')</m> so that <m>x \in B''</m> as well.
            Then it cannot be that <m>x \lt '' x</m> since <m>\lt ''</m> is a simple order.
            If <m>(B'',\lt '') \prec (B,\lt )</m> then
            <m>(B'',\lt '')</m> is a section of <m>(B,\lt )</m>.
            If <m>x \in B''</m> then again it cannot be that
            <m>x \lt '' x</m> since <m>\lt ''</m> is a simple order.
            If <m>x \notin B''</m> then
            <m>(x, x) \notin \lt ''</m> since it is a relation on <m>B''</m>.
            Thus in all cases and sub-cases it is not true that <m>x \lt '' x</m> so that
            <m>x \lt ' x</m> does not hold since <m>\lt ''</m> was arbitrary and <m>\lt '</m> is their union.
            This shows that <m>\lt '</m> is nonreflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, suppose that <m>x \lt ' y</m> and <m>y \lt ' z</m>.
            Then it has to be that there is a
            <m>(B_1, \lt _1)</m> and <m>(B_2, \lt _2)</m> in <m>\cB</m> where
            <m>z \lt _1 y</m> and <m>y \lt _2 z</m>.
            Then <m>(B_1, \lt _1)</m> and
            <m>(B_2, \lt _2)</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m> since <m>\cB</m> is simply ordered.
            Hence one is a section of the other so that, in either case,
            it follows that <m>x \lt y</m> and <m>y \lt z</m> where either
            <m>\lt = \lt _1</m> or <m>\lt = \lt _2</m>.
            Then clearly <m>x \lt z</m> since both <m>\lt _1</m> and <m>\lt _2</m> are transitive since they are simple orders.
            Thus <m>x \lt ' z</m> since <m>\lt '</m> is the union of all the orders in <m>\cB</m> and <m>\lt</m> is such an order.
            This shows that <m>\lt '</m> is transitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the proof that <m>\lt '</m> is a simple order on <m>B'</m>.
            To show that it is a well-order,
            consider any nonempty subset <m>A \ss B'</m>.
            Then there is an <m>x \in A</m> so that <m>x \in B'</m> as well.
            It then follows that there is a
            <m>(B, \lt ) \in \cB</m> where <m>x \in B</m>.
            Then clearly <m>B \cap A</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>B</m> since <m>x \in B</m> and <m>x \in A</m>.
            Let <m>b</m> be the <m>\lt</m>-smallest element in <m>B \cap A</m>,
            and we claim that this is the smallest element of <m>A</m> by <m>\lt '</m>.
            First, obviously <m>b \in A</m> since <m>b \in B \cap A</m>.
            Next consider any <m>y \in A</m> so that <m>y \in B'</m> as well.
            Then there is a <m>(B'', \lt '') \in \cB</m> where <m>y \in B''</m>.
            Since <m>\cB</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> we have that
            <m>(B,\lt )</m> and <m>(B'',\lt '')</m> are comparable.
            Hence <m>(B,\lt )</m> is a section of <m>(B'',\lt '')</m> or vice-versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first case we have that both <m>b</m> and <m>y</m> are in <m>B''</m>.
            If <m>y \in B</m> then also <m>y \in B \cap A</m> so that
            <m>b \leq y</m> since it is the smallest element of <m>B \cap A</m> by <m>\lt</m>.
            If <m>y \notin B</m> then <m>b \lt '' y</m> since <m>B</m> is a section of <m>B''</m>,
            and therefore <m>b \leq'' y</m> is true.
            In the second case in which <m>(B'',\lt '')</m> is a section of
            <m>(B,\lt )</m> we have that both <m>b</m> and <m>y</m> are in <m>B</m> and hence in <m>B \cap A</m>.
            Then, again <m>b \leq y</m> since <m>b</m> is the smallest element of <m>B \cap A</m> by <m>\lt</m>.
            Hence in all cases either <m>b \leq y</m> or <m>b \leq'' y</m>.
            Either way it follows that
            <m>b \leq' y</m> as well since <m>\lt '</m> is the union.
            This shows that <m>b</m> is the smallest element of <m>A</m> by <m>\lt '</m> as desired.
            Since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary nonempty subset,
            this shows that <m>B'</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt '</m>.

          Use Exercises<nbsp/>1 and 5 to prove the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Theorem.</em> The maximum principle is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that the maximum principle is true and let <m>X</m> be any set.
            Then let <m>\cA</m> be the collection of all pairs <m>(A,\lt )</m>,
            where <m>A \ss X</m> and <m>\lt</m> is a well-ordering of <m>A</m> as in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.5.
            Define the relation <m>\prec</m> on <m>\cA</m> also as in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.5, i.e <m>(A,\lt ) \prec (A', \lt ')</m> if
            <m>(A,\lt )</m> is a section of <m>(A',\lt ')</m>.
            It was then shown in that exercise that <m>\prec</m> is a strict partial order on <m>\cA</m> so that,
            by the maximum principle,
            there is a maximal simply ordered subset <m>\cB \ss \cA</m>.
            Now let <m>(B', \lt ')</m> be the unions of the corresponding elements of <m>\cB</m> so that we know that <m>\lt '</m> well-orders <m>B'</m> by part<nbsp/>(b) of Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.5.
          </p>
          <p>
            We claim that <m>B' = X</m>.
            Suppose that this is not the case so that there is a <m>x \in X</m> where <m>x \notin B'</m>
            (since we know that <m>B' \ss X</m>).
            Then define <m>B'' = B' \cup \braces{x}</m> and the relation <m>\lt '' = \lt ' \cup \braces{(b', x) \where b' \in B'}</m>.
            It is then easy to see
            (and trivial but tedious to show)
            that <m>B''</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt ''</m>.
            Also, clearly <m>B'</m> is the section of <m>B''</m> by <m>x</m> so that,
            for any <m>B \in \cB</m>, we have <m>B \eprec B' \prec B''</m>.
            Since <m>B</m> was arbitrary,
            this shows that the set <m>\cB \cup \braces{B''}</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> and is a subset of <m>\cA</m>.
            Since <m>x \notin B'</m> we have that
            <m>x \notin B</m> for any <m>B \in \cB</m>
            (since <m>B'</m> is their union)
            so that <m>B'' \neq B</m> since <m>x \in B</m>.
            It follows that <m>\cB \pss \cB \cup \braces{B''}</m>,
            but this contradicts the maximality of <m>\cB</m>!
            So it has to be that in fact <m>B' = X</m> itself so that <m>\lt '</m> is a well-ordering of <m>X</m>.
            Since <m>X</m> was an arbitrary set,
            this shows the well-ordering theorem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose the well-ordering theorem and that <m>A</m> is a set with strict partial ordering <m>\prec</m>.
            Then we know that <m>A</m> has a well-ordering, say <m>\lt</m>.
            Now, for any function <m>f</m> from a section <m>S_x</m>
            (by <m>\lt</m>)
            to <m>\pset{A}</m>, define
            <md>
              <mrow>\r(f) = \begin{cases}\bigcup f(S_x) \cup \braces{x} \amp  \text{if \(\prec\) is a simple order on \(\bigcup f(S_x) \cup \braces{x}\)}  \\ \bigcup f(S_x) \amp  \text{ otherwise }  \,. \end{cases}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Then by the general principle of recursive defamation (Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.1) there is a unique function <m>h : A \to \pset{A}</m> such that
            <m>h(\a) = \r(h \rest S_\a)</m> for all <m>\a \in A</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First we show that, for <m>\a,\b \in A</m> where <m>\a \lt \b</m>,
            we have <m>h(\a) \ss h(\b)</m>.
            So consider any <m>x \in h(\a) = \r(h \rest S_\a)</m>,
            and hence either <m>x \in \bigcup h(S_\a) \cup \braces{\a}</m> or <m>x \in \bigcup h(S_\a)</m>.
            Either way obviously <m>x \in \bigcup h(S_\a)</m> so that there is a set
            <m>X \in h(S_\a)</m> where <m>x \in X</m>.
            Then there is a <m>\g \in S_\a</m> where <m>X = h(\g)</m>.
            Since we have <m>\a \lt \b</m>,
            clearly also <m>\g \in S_\b</m> and hence <m>X \in h(S_\b)</m>.
            Then also clearly both <m>x \in \bigcup h(S_\b) \cup \braces{\b}</m> and
            <m>x \in \bigcup h(S_\b)</m> so that for sure <m>x \in \r(h \rest S_\b) = h(\b)</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary this shows that <m>h(\a) \ss h(\b)</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we show by transfinite induction that <m>h(\a)</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> for every <m>\a \in A</m>.
            So consider <m>\a \in A</m> and suppose that <m>h(\b)</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> for every <m>\b \lt \a</m>.
            If <m>\bigcup h(S_\a) \cup \braces{\a}</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m> then clearly <m>h(\a)</m> is since then <m>h(\a) = \r(h \rest S_\a) = \bigcup h(S_\a) \cup \braces{\a}</m>.
            So suppose that this is not the case so that <m>h(\a) = \r(h \rest S_\a) = \bigcup h(S_\a)</m>.
            Consider then any <m>x,y \in h(\a) = \bigcup h(S_\a)</m> where
            <m>x \neq y</m> so that there are <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> in <m>h(S_\a)</m> where <m>x \in X</m> and <m>y \in Y</m>.
            Then there is a <m>\b</m> and <m>\g</m> in <m>S_\a</m> where
            <m>X = h(\b)</m> and <m>Y = h(\g)</m>.
            If <m>\b = \g</m> then <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both in <m>X = h(\b) = h(\g) = Y</m>,
            which is simply ordered by the induction hypothesis so that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m>.
            If <m>\b \lt \g</m> then by what was shown above we have that
            <m>x \in X = h(\b) \ss h(\g)</m> so that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both in <m>h(\g)</m>,
            which is simply ordered by the induction hypothesis so that again <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable.
            A similar argument shows that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both in <m>h(\b)</m> and thus are comparable when <m>\b > \g</m>.
            This completes the induction since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable in all cases so that <m>h(\a)</m> is always simply ordered.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then claim that the set
            <m>B = \bigcup_{\a \in A} h(\a)</m> is a maximal simply ordered
            (by <m>\prec</m>)
            subset of <m>A</m>, which of course shows the maximum principle.
            First, it is obviously a subset of <m>A</m> since each
            <m>h(\a) \in \pset{A}</m> so and so is a subset of <m>A</m>.
            To show that that <m>B</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>,
            consider <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>B</m> where
            <m>x \neq y</m> so that there is an <m>\a</m> and <m>\b</m> in <m>A</m> where
            <m>x \in h(\a)</m> and <m>y \in h(\b)</m>.
            Without loss of generality we can assume that <m>\a \lt \b</m> so that
            <m>h(\a) \ss h(\b)</m> by what was shown below.
            Then both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in <m>h(\b)</m>,
            which is simply ordered by what was shown above.
            Hence <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m> so that <m>B</m> is simply ordered.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>B</m> is maximal,
            suppose that <m>B \pss Z</m> and <m>Z \ss A</m> is simply ordered by <m>\prec</m>.
            Then there is a <m>z \in Z</m> where <m>z \notin B</m>.
            Now let <m>x \in \bigcup h(S_z)</m> so that there is an
            <m>X \in h(S_z)</m> where <m>x \in X</m>.
            Then there is an <m>\a \in S_z</m> where <m>x \in X = h(\a)</m>.
            Hence clearly <m>x \in B</m> so that also <m>x \in Z</m> and so <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> are comparable in <m>\prec</m> since <m>Z</m> is simply ordered.
            Since <m>x</m> was arbitrary this shows that the set
            <m>\bigcup h(S_z) \cup \braces{z}</m> is simply ordered so that <m>h(z) = \r(h \rest S_z) = \bigcup h(S_z) \cup \braces{z}</m>.
            However, then we have that
            <m>z \in h(z)</m> so that <m>z \in B</m>, which is a contradiction.
            So it must be that there is no such set <m>Z</m> and hence <m>B</m> is maximal.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>(T_1,\lt _1)</m> and
            <m>(T_2,\lt _2)</m> are both well-ordered sets,
            it follows from Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.4 part<nbsp/>(a) that either they have the same order type,
            <m>T_1</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>T_2</m>,
            or vice-versa.
            We can assume that either they have the same order type of <m>T_1</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>T_2</m> since,
            in the third case,
            we can just swap the roles of <m>T_1</m> and <m>T_2</m>.
            Thus there is an order preserving function
            <m>h: T_1 \to T_2</m> whose image is either all of <m>T_2</m> or a section of <m>T_2</m>.
            Given this, it was shown in the proof of Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(a) that
            <m>h(S_x(T_1)) = S_{h(x)}(T_2)</m> for all <m>x \in T_1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show that <m>h(x) = x</m> for all
            <m>x \in T_1</m> by transfinite induction.
            So suppose that <m>h(y) = y</m> for all <m>y \lt  x</m>,
            i.e. for all <m>y \in S_x(T_1)</m> so that clearly <m>h(S_x(T_1)) = S_x(T_1)</m>.
            Then, since both <m>T_1</m> and <m>T_2</m> are towers in <m>X</m> and <m>h(x) \in T_2</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>h(x) = c(X - S_{h(x)}(T_2)) = c(X - h(S_x(T_1))) = c(X - S_x(T_1)) = x \,</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This completes the induction.
            Since <m>h(x) = x</m> for all
            <m>x \in T_1</m> and <m>h</m> preserves order,
            it follows that <m>T_1</m> is equal to <m>T_2</m> or a section of <m>T_2</m> as desired.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>T \neq X</m>, it follows that <m>X - T</m> is nonempty.
            So let <m>a = c(X - T)</m>, <m>T' = T \cup \braces{a}</m>,
            and <m>\lt ' = \lt \cup \braces{(x,a) \where x \in T}</m>.
            Then clearly <m>a</m> is the largest element of <m>T'</m> and an upper bound of <m>T</m> so that <m>T = S_a(T')</m>,
            and hence <m>a = c(X-T) = c(X-S_a(T'))</m>.
            Since <m>T</m> is a tower,
            it then follows that <m>T'</m> is also a tower in <m>X</m> and that <m>T</m> is a section of <m>T'</m> as desired.

            First we need to show that <m>\lt</m> is even a well-ordering of <m>T</m> as this is not obvious.
            To show that it is a simple order,
            consider <m>x,y \in T</m> where <m>x \neq y</m>.
            It follows that <m>x \in T_k</m> and <m>y \in T_l</m> for some
            <m>k,l \in K</m> by the definition of <m>T</m>.
            Since <m>T_k</m> and <m>T_l</m> are both towers in <m>X</m>,
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that they are equal or one is a section of the other.
            So, without loss of generality,
            we can assume that <m>T_k \ss T_l</m> and also <m>\lt _k \ss \lt _l</m>.
            It then follows that both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in <m>T_l</m> so that either
            <m>x \lt _l y</m> or <m>y \lt _l x</m> since
            <m>x \neq y</m> and <m>\lt _l</m> is a simple order.
            Then clearly <m>x \lt y</m> or <m>y \lt x</m> from the definition of <m>\lt</m>.
            This shows that <m>\lt</m> has the comparability property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now suppose that there is an <m>x \in T</m> where <m>x \lt x</m>.
            Then there is a <m>k \in K</m> where <m>x \lt _k x</m>,
            which violates the fact that <m>\lt _k</m> is a simple order.
            Hence it must be that <m>\lt</m> is nonreflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly consider <m>x,y,z \in T</m> where <m>x \lt y</m> and <m>y \lt z</m>.
            Then there <m>k,l \in K</m> where <m>x \lt _k y</m> and
            <m>y \lt _l z</m> and it must then be that
            <m>x,y \in T_k</m> and <m>y,z \in T_l</m>.
            Again, since these are both towers,
            they are either equal or one is a section of the other by part<nbsp/>(a).
            So we can assume that <m>T_k \ss T_l</m> and
            <m>\lt _k \ss \lt _l</m> without loss of generality so that we have
            <m>x,y,z \in T_l</m> and <m>x \lt _l y \lt _l z</m>.
            From this clearly <m>x \lt _l z</m> since it is a simple order and therefore transitive.
            Hence we have <m>x \lt y</m>,
            which of course shows that <m>\lt</m> is transitive as well.
            This all shows that <m>\lt</m> is indeed a simple order by definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show that <m>\lt</m> is a well-ordering,
            consider any nonempty subset <m>Y</m> of <m>T</m>.
            Then there is a <m>b \in Y</m> so that also <m>b \in T</m>.
            It follows that there is a <m>k \in K</m> such that <m>b \in T_k</m>,
            and also that <m>Y \cap T_k</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>T_k</m>.
            It then follows that <m>Y \cap T_k</m> has a smallest element <m>a</m> since <m>T_k</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt _k</m>.
            We claim that in fact <m>a</m> is the smallest element of all of <m>Y</m>.
            To see this,
            consider any other <m>x \in Y</m> so that also <m>x \in T</m>.
            Hence there is an <m>l \in K</m> where <m>x \in T_l</m>.
            Now, since both <m>T_k</m> and <m>T_l</m> are towers in <m>X</m>,
            it follows from part<nbsp/>(a) that they are equal or one is a section of the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>T_k</m> and <m>T_l</m> are equal.
            Then both <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>T_k</m> and so both in <m>Y \cap T_k</m>.
            Then <m>a \leq_k x</m> since <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>Y \cap T_k</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>T_k</m> is a section of <m>T_l</m>.
            Then, if <m>a \in T_k</m> then the argument in the previous case shows that <m>a \leq_k x</m>.
            On the other hand, if <m>a \notin T_k</m>,
            then it has to be that that <m>x \lt _l a</m> since
            <m>x \in T_k</m> and <m>T_k</m> is a section of <m>T_l</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case: <m>T_l</m> is a section of <m>T_k</m>.
            Then <m>T_l \ss T_k</m> so that both <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> are in <m>T_k</m> and thus in <m>Y \cap T_k</m>.
            Hence again <m>a \leq_k x</m> since <m>a</m> is the smallest element of <m>Y \cap T_k</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all cases <m>a \leq_m x</m> for some <m>m \in K</m> and hence <m>a \leq x</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>Y</m>,
            this shows that <m>a</m> is in fact the smallest element of <m>Y</m>.
            Since <m>Y</m> was an arbitrary nonempty subset of <m>T</m>,
            this shows that <m>T</m> is well-ordered by <m>\lt</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we digress for a moment to show,
            for any <m>k \in K</m> and <m>x \in T_k</m>,
            that <m>S_x(T_k) = S_x(T)</m>.
            So consider such <m>k</m> and <m>x</m> and suppose that
            <m>y \in S_x(T_k)</m> so that <m>y \lt _k x</m>.
            Then clearly also <m>y \lt x</m> by the definition of <m>\lt</m> and hence <m>y \in S_x(T)</m>.
            This shows that <m>S_x(T_k) \ss S_x(T)</m> since <m>y</m> was arbitrary.
            Now suppose <m>y \in S_x(T)</m> so that <m>y \lt x</m>.
            Then there is an <m>l \in K</m> where <m>y \lt _l x</m>.
            Hence <m>x,y \in T_l</m>,
            and by part<nbsp/>(a) either <m>T_l</m> and <m>T_k</m> are equal,
            or one is a section of the other.
            If they are equal or <m>T_l</m> is a section of <m>T_k</m> then clearly we have
            <m>\lt _l \ss \lt _k</m> so that <m>y \lt _k x</m>.
            If <m>T_k</m> is a section of <m>T_l</m> then,
            since <m>y \lt _l x</m> and <m>x \in T_k</m>,
            it has to be that also <m>y \in T_k</m> since <m>T_k</m> is a section of <m>T_l</m>.
            Hence it must be that <m>y \lt _k x</m>.
            Since this is true in all cases it follows that <m>y \in S_x(T_k)</m>,
            which shows that <m>S_x(T) \ss S_x(T_k)</m>.
            This completes the proof that <m>S_x(T_k) = S_x(T)</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this having been shown,
            we can easily show that <m>T</m> is a tower in <m>X</m>.
            For any <m>x \in T</m> there is a <m>k \in K</m> where <m>x \in T_k</m>.
            Since <m>T_k</m> is a tower in <m>X</m> we have
            <md>
              <mrow>x = c(X - S_x(T_k)) = c(X - S_x(T))</mrow>
            </md>
            by what was just shown.
            Thus suffices to show that <m>T</m> is a tower in <m>X</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, we claim that <m>T = X</m>.
            To see this,
            suppose that it is not the case so that by part<nbsp/>(b) there is a tower <m>S</m> in <m>X</m> such that <m>T</m> is a section of <m>S</m>.
            From this we have that <m>T = S_a(S)</m> for some <m>a \in S</m> and that of course <m>a \notin T</m>.
            However, since <m>S</m> is a tower and <m>\braces{(T_k,\lt _k) \where k \in K}</m> is the collection of
            <em>all</em> towers in <m>X</m>,
            it follows that there must be a <m>k \in K</m> such that <m>S = T_k</m>.
            Then we have that <m>a \in S = T_k</m> so that of course <m>a \in T</m> by definition,
            which is a contradiction.
            So it must be that in fact <m>T = X</m> as desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            This of course shows that <m>\lt</m> is a well-ordering of <m>X = T</m> so that the choice axiom implies the well-ordering theorem since <m>X</m> is an arbitrary set.
            In contrast to the previous proof,
            it is easy to prove that the well-ordering theorem implies the choice axiom.
            For a collection of nonempty sets <m>\cB</m> define <m>X = \bigcup \cB</m>.
            Then <m>X</m> can be well-ordered by the well-ordering theorem.
            Then we simply define a choice function <m>c</m> on <m>\cB</m> in the following way:
            any <m>B \in \cB</m> is clearly a nonempty subset of <m>X</m> and so has a smallest element <m>a</m> since <m>X</m> is well ordered.
            So simply set <m>c(B) = a</m>,
            from which it is clear that
            <m>c(B) \in B</m> and so <m>c</m> is a valid choice function.

        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, to show that <m>\ll</m> is well defined,
            suppose that <m>[(A,\lt )] \ll [(A',\lt ')]</m> and that
            <m>(B,\prec) \in [(A,\lt )]</m> and <m>(B',\prec') \in [(A',\lt ')]</m>.
            Then <m>(A,\lt )</m> has the same order type as a section of
            <m>(A',\lt ')</m> so that there is an order-preserving map <m>h</m> from <m>A</m> onto a section of <m>A'</m>.
            We also then have that <m>(B,\prec)</m> has the same order type as
            <m>(A,\lt )</m> since they are in the same equivalence class.
            Thus there is an order-preserving bijection <m>f : B \to A</m>.
            Likewise there is an order-preserving bijection from <m>g : B' \to A'</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that
            <m>\inv{g} \circ h \circ f</m> is bijection from <m>B</m> onto a section of <m>B'</m> that preserves order.
            Hence <m>(B, \prec)</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>(B',\prec')</m>.
            Since <m>(B, \prec)</m> and
            <m>(B', \prec')</m> were arbitrary elements in their respective equivalence classes,
            this shows that <m>\ll</m> is well defined such that it does not matter which representatives we use from the equivalence classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider any equivalence class <m>[(A,\lt )]</m> in <m>E</m>.
            Then clearly it cannot be that <m>[(A,\lt )] \ll [(A,\lt )]</m>,
            since this would mean that <m>A</m> has the same order type as a section of itself,
            which would contradict what was shown in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(b).
            Thus <m>\ll</m> is nonreflexive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next consider two distinct equivalence classes
            <m>[(A,\lt )]</m> and <m>[(A',\lt ')]</m>.
            Then it cannot be that <m>(A,\lt )</m> and
            <m>(A',\lt ')</m> have the same order type,
            for then they would be the same equivalence class.
            Then, by Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.4 part<nbsp/>(a),
            it must be that either <m>(A,\lt )</m> has the same order type as a section of <m>(A',\lt ')</m> or vice-versa.
            Clearly then,
            in the former case <m>[(A,\lt )] \ll [(A',\lt ')]</m>,
            and in the latter case <m>[(A',\lt ')] \ll [(A,\lt )]</m>.
            This shows that <m>\ll</m> has the comparability property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, suppose that <m>[(A,\lt )] \ll [(A',\lt ')]</m> and <m>[(A',\lt ')] \ll [(A'',\lt '')]</m>.
            Then <m>(A,\lt )</m> has the same order type as section of
            <m>(A',\lt ')</m> so that there is an order-preserving bijection <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> onto a section of <m>A'</m> Likewise there is an order-preserving bijection <m>g</m> from <m>A'</m> onto a section of <m>A''</m>.
            It is then trivial to show that
            <m>f \circ g</m> is an order-preserving bijection from <m>A</m> onto a section of <m>A''</m>.
            It then clearly follows that <m>[(A,\lt )] \ll [(A'',\lt '')]</m>,
            which shows that <m>\ll</m> is transitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence we have shown that <m>\ll</m> satisfies all the requirements of a simple order.

            Consider any <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>A</m> where <m>x \lt  y</m>.

            (since it is not true that <m>x \lt  x</m>)
            so that <m>S_x(A)</m> and <m>S_y(A)</m> are distinct sets.
            We also clearly have that <m>S_x(A) = S_x(S_y(A))</m> so that <m>S_x(A)</m> has the same order type
            (the identity function is the required order-preserving map)

            so that <m>f</m> preserves order since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we show that <m>f</m> is onto <m>S_\a(E)</m>.
            So consider any equivalence class
            <m>[(B,\prec)]</m> in <m>S_\a(E)</m> and hence
            <md>
              <mrow>\ll \a = [(A,\lt )]</mrow>
            </md>
            so that by definition <m>(B,\prec)</m> has the same order type as some section <m>S_x(A)</m>.
            Hence <m>[(B,\prec)]</m> and
            <m>[(S_x(A),\text{ restriction \(\lt \) } )]</m> are the same equivalence class!
            Therefore
            <md>
              <mrow>f(x) = [(S_x(A),\text{ restriction \(\lt \) } )] = [(B,\prec)] \,</mrow>
            </md>,
            which of course shows the desired property since <m>[(B,\prec)]</m> was arbitrary.
          </p>
          <p>
            This shows that <m>f</m> is an order-preserving map from <m>A</m> onto <m>S_\a(E)</m> so that they have the same order type.

        </proof>
        <p>
          (c)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider any nonempty subset <m>D \ss E</m>.
            Thus there is an <m>\a = [(A,\lt )] \in D</m>.
            If <m>\a</m> is the smallest element of <m>D</m> then we are done,
            so assume that this is not the case so that there is a
            <m>\b \in D</m> where <m>\b \ll \a</m>.
            Now, it was shown in part<nbsp/>(b) that
            <m>(A,\lt )</m> has the same order type as the section <m>S_\a(E)</m> so that this section must be well-ordered since <m>A</m> is.
            Also we have that <m>\b \in S_\a(E)</m> since <m>\b \ll \a</m>.
            Thus <m>\b \in D \cap S_\a(E)</m> so that
            <m>D \cap S_\a(E)</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>S_\a(E)</m> so has a smallest element <m>\g</m> since <m>S_\a(E)</m> is well-ordered.
            In particular, we of course have that <m>\g \lll \b</m>,
            where we use <m>\lll</m> to denote <m>\ll</m> or equal to.
          </p>
          <p>
            We claim that <m>\g</m> must be the smallest element of <m>D</m>.
            If not, then there is a <m>\d \in D</m> where <m>\d \ll \g</m>.
            Of course we also then have that
            <m>\d \ll \g \lll \b \ll \a</m> and hence <m>\d \in S_\a(E)</m>.
            Therefore <m>\d \in D \cap S_\a(E)</m>,
            but since <m>\d \ll \g</m> this contradicts the definition of <m>\g</m> as the smallest element of <m>D \cap S_\a(E)</m>.
            So it must be that in fact <m>\g</m> is the smallest element of <m>D</m>,
            which shows that <m>E</m> is well-ordered by <m>\ll</m> since <m>D</m> was an arbitrary subset.
          </p>
        </proof>
        <p>
          (d)
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Following the hint,
            suppose that <m>E</m> is countable so that there is a bijection <m>h : E \to \pints</m>.
            This of course gives rise to a well-ordering <m>\lt</m> of
            <m>h(E) = \pints</m> by simply ordering its elements according to its bijection with <m>E</m>,
            which was shown to be well-ordered in part<nbsp/>(c).
            Then we have that <m>(\pints, \lt )</m> is an element of <m>\cA</m> since <m>\pints</m> is a subset of itself.
            Thus the equivalence class
            <m>\a = [(\pints,\lt )]</m> is an element of <m>E</m>.
            But we know from part<nbsp/>(b) that
            <m>(\pints,\lt )</m> then has the same order type as the section <m>S_\a(E)</m>.
            Since we also know that <m>(\pints,\lt )</m> has the same order type as <m>E</m> itself,
            it follows that <m>E</m> has the same order type as its section <m>S_\a(E)</m>.
            This was shown not to be possible in Exercise<nbsp/>\thesubsection.2 part<nbsp/>(b) so that a contradiction has been reached.
            So it must be that in fact <m>E</m> is uncountable as desired!
